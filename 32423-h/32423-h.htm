<p><span class="bold">COUCY-LE-CHÂTEAU,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a village of northern France, in the
department of Aisne, 18 m. W.S.W. of Laon on a branch of the
Northern railway. Pop. (1906) 663. It has extensive remains of
fortifications of the 13th century, the most remarkable feature of
which is the Porte de Laon, a gateway flanked by massive towers
and surmounted by a fine apartment. Coucy also has a church of
the 15th century, preserving a façade in the Romanesque style.
The importance of the place is due, however, to the magnificent
ruins of a feudal fortress (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Castle</a></span>) crowning the eminence
on the slope of which the village is built. The remains, which
embrace an area of more than 10,000 sq. yds., form an irregular
quadrilateral built round a court-yard and flanked by four huge
towers. The nucleus of the stronghold is a donjon over 200 ft.
high and over 100 ft. in diameter, standing on the south side
of the court. Three large vaulted apartments, one above the
other, occupy its interior. The court-yard was surrounded on the
ground-floor by storehouses, kitchens, &amp;c., above which on the
west and north sides were the great halls known as the <i>Salle des
preux</i> and the <i>Salle des preuses</i>. A chapel projected from the
west wing. The bailey or base-court containing other buildings
and covering three times the area of the château extended
between it and the village. The architectural unity of the
fortress is due to the rapidity of its construction, which took
place between 1230 and 1242, under Enguerrand III., lord of
Coucy. A large part of the buildings was restored or enlarged
at the end of the 14th century by Louis d&rsquo;Orléans, brother of
Charles VI., by whom it had been purchased. The place was
dismantled in 1652 by order of Cardinal Mazarin. It is now
state property. In 1856 researches were carried on upon the spot
by Viollet-le-Duc, and measures for the preservation of the ruins
were subsequently undertaken.</p>

<p><i>Sires de Coucy.</i>&mdash;Coucy gave its name to the sires de Coucy, a
feudal house famous in the history of France. The founder of the
family was Enguerrand de Boves, a warlike lord, who, at the end of
the 11th century seized the castle of Coucy by force. Towards
the close of his life, he had to fight against his own son, Thomas
de Marle, who in 1115 succeeded him, subsequently becoming
notorious for his deeds of violence in the struggles between the
communes of Laon and Amiens. He was subdued by King Louis
VI. in 1117, but his son Enguerrand II. continued the struggle
against the king. Enguerrand III., the Great, fought at Bouvines
under Philip Augustus (1214), but later he was accused of
aiming at the crown of France, and he took part in the disturbances
which arose during the regency of Blanche of Castile.
These early lords of Coucy remained till the 14th century in
possession of the land from which they took their name.
Enguerrand IV., sire de Coucy, died in 1320 without issue and was
succeeded by his nephew Enguerrand, son of Arnold, count of
Guines, and Alix de Coucy, from whom is descended the second
line of the house of Coucy. Enguerrand VI. had his lands
ravaged by the English in 1339 and died at Crécy in 1346.
Enguerrand VII., sire de Coucy, count of Soissons and Marle, and
chief butler of France, was sent as a hostage to England, where he
married Isabel, the eldest daughter of King Edward III. Wishing
to remain neutral in the struggle between England and
France, he went to fight in Italy. Having made claims upon the
domains of the house of Austria, from which he was descended
through his mother, he was defeated in battle (1375-1376). He
was entrusted with various diplomatic negotiations, and took
part in the crusade of Hungary against the Sultan Bayezid,
during which he was taken prisoner, and died shortly after the
battle of Nicopolis (1397). His daughter Marie sold the fief of
Coucy to Louis, duke of Orleans, in 1400. The Châtelain de
Coucy (see above) did not belong to the house of the lords of
Coucy, but was castellan of the castle of that name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUES, ELLIOTT<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> (1842-1899), American naturalist, was born
at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 9th of September 1842.
He graduated at Columbian (now George Washington) University,
Washington, D.C., in 1861, and at the Medical school of that
institution in 1863. He served as a medical cadet at Washington
in 1862-1863, and in 1864 was appointed assistant-surgeon in the
regular army. In 1872 he published his <i>Key to North American
Birds</i>, which, revised and rewritten in 1884 and 1901, has done
much to promote the systematic study of ornithology in America.
In 1873-1876 Coues was attached as surgeon and naturalist to the
United States Northern Boundary Commission, and in 1876-1880
was secretary and naturalist to the United States Geological and
Geographical Survey of the Territories, the publications of which
he edited. He was lecturer on anatomy in the medical school
of the Columbian University in 1877-1882, and professor of
anatomy there in 1882-1887. He resigned from the army in 1881
to devote himself entirely to scientific research. He was a
founder of the American Ornithologists&rsquo; Union, and edited its
organ, <i>The Auk</i>, and several other ornithological periodicals. He
died at Baltimore, Maryland, on the 25th of December 1899.
In addition to ornithology he did valuable work in mammalogy;
his book <i>Fur-Bearing Animals</i> (1877) being distinguished by the
accuracy and completeness of its description of species, several of
which are already becoming rare. In 1887 he became president of
the Esoteric Theosophical Society of America. Among the most
important of his publications, in several of which he had collaboration,
are <i>A Field Ornithology</i> (1874); <i>Birds of the North-west</i> (1874);
<i>Monographs on North American Rodentia</i>, with J. A. Allen (1877);
<i>Birds of the Colorado Valley</i> (1878); <i>A Bibliography of Ornithology</i>
(1878-1880, incomplete); <i>New England Bird Life</i> (1881); <i>A
Dictionary and Check List of North American Birds</i> (1882);
<i>Biogen, A Speculation on the Origin and Motive of Life</i> (1884);
<i>The Daemon of Darwin</i> (1884); <i>Can Matter Think?</i> (1886); and
<i>Neuro-Myology</i> (1887). He also contributed numerous articles
to the Century Dictionary, wrote for various encyclopaedias, and
edited the <i>Journals of Lewis and Clark</i> (1893), and <i>The Travels of
Zebulon M. Pike</i> (1895).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COULISSE<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (French for &ldquo;groove,&rdquo; from <i>couler</i>, to slide), a term
for a groove in which a gate of a sluice, or the side-scenes in a
theatre, slide up and down, hence applied to the space on the
stage between the wings, and generally to that part of the theatre
&ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; and out of view of the public. It is also
a term of the Paris Bourse, derived from a <i>coulisse</i>, or passage
in which transactions were carried on without the authorized
<i>agents de change</i>. The name <i>coulissier</i> was thus given to unauthorized
<i>agents de change</i>, or &ldquo;outside brokers&rdquo; who, after
many attempts at suppression, were finally given a recognized
status in 1901. They bring business to the <i>agents de change</i>, and
act as intermediaries between them and other parties. (See

<p><span class="bold">COULOMB, CHARLES AUGUSTIN<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1736-1806), French
natural philosopher, was born at Angoulême on the 14th of June
1736. He chose the profession of military engineer, spent three
years, to the decided injury of his health, at Fort Bourbon,
Martinique, and was employed on his return at Rochelle, the
Isle of Aix and Cherbourg. In 1781 he was stationed permanently
at Paris, but on the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 he
resigned his appointment as <i>intendant des eaux et fontaines</i>, and
retired to a small estate which he possessed at Blois. He was
recalled to Paris for a time in order to take part in the new
determination of weights and measures, which had been decreed
by the Revolutionary government. Of the National Institute he
was one of the first members; and he was appointed inspector
of public instruction in 1802. But his health was already very
feeble, and four years later he died at Paris on the 23rd of
August 1806. Coulomb is distinguished in the history alike of
mechanics and of electricity and magnetism. In 1779 he published
an important investigation of the laws of friction (<i>Théorie
des machines simples, en ayant regard au frottement de leurs parties
et à la roideur des cordages</i>), which was followed twenty years later
by a memoir on fluid resistance. In 1785 appeared his <i>Recherches
théoriques et expérimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l&rsquo;élasticité
des fils de métal</i>, &amp;c. This memoir contained a description of
different forms of his torsion balance, an instrument used by him
with great success for the experimental investigation of the
distribution of electricity on surfaces and of the laws of electrical
and magnetic action, of the mathematical theory of which he may
also be regarded as the founder. The practical unit of quantity
of electricity, the <i>coulomb</i>, is named after him.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COULOMMIERS,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Seine-et-Marne, 45 m. E.
of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906) 5217. It is situated in the fertile
district of Brie, in a valley watered by the Grand-Morin. The
church of St Denis (13th and 16th centuries), and the ruins of a
castle built by Catherine of Gonzaga, duchess of Longueville,
in the early 17th century, are of little importance. There is a
statue to Commandant Beaurepaire, who, in 1792, killed himself
rather than surrender Verdun to the Prussians. Coulommiers
is the seat of a subprefect, and has a tribunal of first
instance and a communal college. Printing is the chief industry,
tanning, flour-milling and sugar-making being also carried on.
Trade is in agricultural products, and especially in cheeses
named after the town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUMARIN,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> C<span class="su">9</span>H<span class="su">6</span>O<span class="su">2</span>, a substance which occurs naturally in
sweet woodruff (<i>Asperula odorata</i>), in the tonka bean and in
yellow melilot (<i>Melilotus officinalis</i>). It can be obtained from the
tonka bean by extraction with alcohol. It is prepared artificially
by heating aceto-ortho-coumaric acid (which is formed from
sodium salicyl aldehyde) or from the action of acetic anhydride
and sodium acetate on salicyl aldehyde (Sir W. H. Perkin,
<i>Berichte</i>, 1875, 8, p. 1599). It can also be prepared by heating a
mixture of phenol and malic acid with sulphuric acid, or by
passing bromine vapour at 107° C. over the anhydride of melilotic
acid. It forms rhombic crystals (from ether) melting at 67° C.
and boiling at 290° C., which are readily soluble in alcohol, and
moderately soluble in hot water. It is applied in perfumery
for the preparation of the <i>Asperula</i> essence. On boiling with
concentrated caustic potash it yields the potassium salt of
coumaric acid, whilst when fused with potash it is completely
decomposed into salicylic and acetic acids. Sodium amalgam
reduces it, in aqueous solution, to melilotic acid. It forms
addition products with bromine and hydrobromic acid. By
the action of phosphorus pentasulphide it is converted into
thiocoumarin, which melts at 101° C.; and in alcoholic solution,
on the addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and soda, it
yields coumarin oxime.</p>

<p>Ortho-coumaric acid (o-oxycinnamic acid) is obtained from
coumarin as shown above, or by boiling coumarin for some time
with sodium ethylate. It melts at 208° C. and is easily soluble in
hot water and in alcohol. It cannot be converted into coumarin
by heating alone, but it is readily transformed on heating with
acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. By the action of sodium
amalgam it is readily converted into <i>melilotic acid</i>, which melts at
81° C., and on distillation furnishes its lactone, <i>hydrocoumarin</i>,
melting at 25° C. For the relations of coumaric and coumarinic
acid see <i>Annalen</i>, 254, p. 181. The homologues of coumarin may
be obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on phenol and the
higher fatty acids (propionic, butyric and isovaleric anhydrides),
substitution taking place at the carbon atom in the &alpha; position to
the -CO- group, whilst by the condensation of acetoacetic
ester and phenols with sulphuric acid the &beta; substituted coumarins
are obtained.</p>

<p><i>Umbelliferone</i> or 4-oxycoumarin, occurs in the bark of <i>Daphne
mezereum</i> and may be obtained by distilling such resins as
galbanum or asafoetida. It may be synthesized from resorcin
and malic anhydride or from &beta; resorcyl aldehyde, acetic
anhydride and sodium acetate. <i>Daphnetin</i> and <i>Aesculetin</i> are
dioxycoumarins.</p>

<p>The structural formulae of coumarin and the related substances are:</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUNCIL<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (Lat. <i>concilium</i>, from <i>cum</i>, together, and the root cal,
to call), the general word for a convocation, meeting, assembly.
The Latin word was frequently confused with <i>consilium</i> (from
<i>consulere</i>, to deliberate, cf. <i>consul</i>), advice, <i>i.e.</i> counsel, and thus
specifically an advisory assembly. Du Cange (<i>Gloss. Med.
Infim. Latin.</i>) quotes the Greek words <span class="grk" title="synodos, synedrion, symboulion">
&#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;, &#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;, &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>   as the equivalent of <i>concilium</i>. In French the
distinction between <i>conseil</i> (from <i>consilium</i>), advice, and
<i>concile</i>, council (<i>i.e.</i> ecclesiastical&mdash;its only meaning) has survived,
but the two English derivatives are much confused. In the New
Testament, &ldquo;council&rdquo; is the rendering of the Hebrew Sanhedrin,
Gr. <span class="grk" title="synedrion">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>. The word is generally used in English for all
kinds of congregations or convocations assembled for administrative
and deliberative purposes.<a name="FnAnchor_1a" id="FnAnchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The present article is confined to a history of the development
of the ecclesiastical council, summoned to adjust matters in
dispute with the civil authority or for the settlement of doctrinal
and other internal disputes. For details see under separate
headings, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nicaea</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From a very early period in the history of the Church, councils
or synods have been held to decide on matters of doctrine and
discipline. They may be traced back to the second half of the
2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, when sundry churches in Asia Minor held
consultations about the rise of Montanism. Their precise origin
is disputed. The common Roman Catholic view is that they are
apostolic though not prescribed by divine law, and the apostolic
precedent usually cited is the &ldquo;council&rdquo; of Jerusalem (Acts xv.;
Galatians ii.). Waiving the consideration of vital critical
questions and accepting Acts xv. at its face value, the assembly at
Jerusalem would scarcely seem to have been a council in the
technical sense of the word; it was in essence a meeting of the
Jerusalem church at which delegates from Antioch were heard
but apparently had no vote, the decision resting solely with the
mother church. R. Sohm argues that synods grew from the
custom of certain local churches which, when confronted with a
serious problem of their own, augmented their numbers by
receiving delegates from the churches of the neighbourhood.
Hauck, however, holds that these augmented church meetings,
which dealt with the affairs of but a single church, are to be
distinguished from the synods, which took cognizance of matters
of general interest. Older Protestant writers have contented
themselves with saying either that synods were of apostolic
origin, or that they were the inevitable outcome of the need of
the leaders of churches to take counsel together, and that they
were perhaps modelled on the secular provincial assemblies
(<i>concilia provincialia</i>).</p>

<p>Every important alteration in the constitution of the Church
has affected the composition and function of synods; but the
changes were neither simultaneous nor precisely alike throughout
the Roman empire. The synods of the 2nd century were extraordinary
assemblies which met to deliberate upon pressing
problems. They had no fixed geographical limits for membership,
no <i>ex-officio</i> members, nor did they possess an authority which
did away with the independence of the local church. In the
course of the 3rd century came the decisive change, which
increased the prestige of the councils: the right to vote was
limited to bishops. This was the logical outgrowth of the
belief that each local church ought to have but one bishop
(monarchical episcopate), and that these bishops were the sole
legitimate successors of the apostles (apostolic succession), and
therefore official organs of the Holy Spirit. Although as late as
250 the consensus of the priests, the deacons and the people was
still considered essential to the validity of a conciliar decision at
Rome and in certain parts of the East, the development had
already run its course in northern Africa. It was a further step
in advance when synods began to meet at regular intervals.
They were held annually in Cappadocia by the middle of the 3rd
century, and the council of Nicaea commanded in 325 that semiannual
synods be held in every province, an arrangement which
was not systematically enforced, and was altered in 692, when
the Trullan Council reduced the number to one a year.</p>

<p>With the multiplication of synods came naturally a differentiation
of type. In text-books we find clear lines drawn between
diocesan, provincial, national, patriarchal and oecumenical
synods; but the first thousand years of church history do not
justify the sharpness of the traditional distinction. The <i>provincial</i>
synods, presided over by the metropolitan (archbishop),
were usually held at the capital of the province, and attempted
to legislate on all sorts of questions. The state had nothing to do
with calling them, nor did their decrees require governmental
sanction. Various abortive attempts were made to set up
synods of <i>patriarchal</i> or at least of more than provincial rank.
In North Africa eighteen such synods were held between 393 and
424; during part of the 5th and 6th centuries <i>primatial</i> councils
assembled at Arles; and the patriarchs of Constantinople were
accustomed to invite to their &ldquo;<i>endemic</i> synods&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="synodoi endêmousai">
&#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#953; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span>) all bishops who happened to be sojourning at the
capital. <i>Papal</i> synods from the 5th and especially from the 9th
century onward included members such as the archbishops of
Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia and Grado, who resided outside the
Roman archdiocese; but the territorial limits from which the
membership was drawn do not appear to have been precisely
defined.</p>

<p>Before the form of the provincial synod had become absolutely
fixed, there arose in the 4th century the <i>oecumenical</i> council.
The Greek term <span class="grk" title="synodos oikoumenikê">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span><a name="FnAnchor_2a" id="FnAnchor_2a" href="#Footnote_2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> (1) (used by Eusebius,
<i>Vita Constantini</i>, iii. 6) is preferable to the Latin <i>concilium
universale</i> or <i>generale</i>, which has been applied loosely to national
and even to provincial synods. The oecumenical synods were not
the logical outgrowth of the network of provincial synods; they
were creations of the imperial power. Constantine, who had not
even been baptized, laid the foundations when, in response to a
petition of the Donatists, he referred their case to a committee of
bishops that convened at Rome, which meeting Eusebius calls a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
synod. After that the emperor summoned the council of Arles to
settle the matter. For both of these assemblies it was the emperor
that decided who should be summoned, paid the travelling
expenses of the bishops, determined where the council should be
held and what topics should be discussed. He regarded them
as temporary advisory bodies, to whose recommendations the
imperial authority might give the force of law. In the same
manner he appointed the time and place for the council of
Nicaea, summoned the episcopate, paid part of the expenses out
of the public purse, nominated the committee in charge of the
order of business, used his influence to bring about the adoption
of the creed, and punished those who refused to subscribe. To be
sure, the council of Nicaea commanded great veneration, for it
was the first attempt to assemble the entire episcopate; but no
more than the synods of Rome and of Arles was it an organ of
ecclesiastical self-government&mdash;it was rather a means whereby
the Church was ruled by the secular power. The subsequent
oecumenical synods of the undivided Church were patterned on
that of Nicaea. Most Protestant scholars maintain that the
secular authorities decided whether or not they should be
convened, and issued the summons; that imperial commissioners
were always present, even if they did not always preside; that on
occasion emperors have confirmed or refused to confirm synodal
decrees; and that the papal confirmation was neither customary
nor requisite. Roman Catholic scholars to-day tend to recede
from the high ground very generally taken several centuries ago,
and Funk even admits that the right to convoke oecumenical
synods was vested in the emperor regardless of the wishes of the
pope, and that it cannot be proved that the Roman see ever
actually had a share in calling the oecumenical councils of
antiquity. Others, however, while acknowledging the futility of
seeking historical proofs that the popes <i>formally</i> called, directed
and confirmed these synods, yet assert that the emperor performed
these functions not of his own right but in his quality as
protector of the Church, that this involved his acting at the
request or at least with the permission and approval of the
Church, and in particular of the pope, and that a special though
not a stereotyped papal confirmation of conciliar decrees was
necessary to their validity.</p>

<p>In the Germanic states which arose on the ruins of the Western
Empire we find <i>national</i> and <i>diocesan</i> synods; provincial synods
were unusual. National synods were summoned by the king or
with his consent to meet special needs; and they were frequently
<i>concilia mixta</i>, at which lay dignitaries appeared. Although the
Frankish monarchs were not <span class="correction" title="amended from abolute">absolute</span> rulers, nevertheless they
exercised the right of changing or rejecting synodal decrees
which ran counter to the interests of the state. Clovis held the
first French national synod at Orleans in 511; Reccared, the
first in Spain in 589 at Toledo. Under Charlemagne they were
occasionally so representative that they might almost be ranked
as general synods of the West (Regensburg, 792, Frankfort, 794).
Contemporaneous with the evolution of the national synod was
the development of a new type of diocesan synod, which included
the priests of separate and mutually independent parishes and
also the leaders of the monastic clergy.</p>

<p>The papal synods came into the foreground with the success of
the Cluniac reform of the Church, especially from the Lateran
synod of 1059 on. They grew in importance until at length
Calixtus II. summoned to the Lateran the synod of 1123 as
&ldquo;<i>generale concilium</i>.&rdquo; The powers which the pope as bishop of
the church in Rome had exercised over its synods he now extended
to the oecumenical councils. They were more completely under
his control than the ancient ones had been under the sway of the
emperor. The Pseudo-Isidorean principle that all major synods
need papal authorization was insisted on, and the decrees were
formulated as papal edicts.</p>

<p>The absolutist principles cherished by the papal court in the
12th and 13th centuries did not pass unchallenged; but the
protests of Marsilius of Padua and the less radical William of
Occam remained barren until the Great Schism of 1378. As
neither the pope in Rome nor his rival in Avignon would give way,
recourse was had to the idea that the supreme power was vested
not in the pope but in the oecumenical council. This &ldquo;conciliar
theory,&rdquo; propounded by Conrad of Gelnhausen and championed
by the great Parisian teachers Pierre d&rsquo;Ailly and Gerson, proceeded
from the nominalistic axiom that the whole is greater
than its part. The decisive revolutionary step was taken when
the cardinals independently of both popes ventured to hold the
council of Pisa (1409). The council of Constance asserted the
supremacy of oecumenical synods, and ordered that these be
convened at regular intervals. The last of the Reform councils,
that of Basel, <span class="correction" title="amended from appoved">approved</span> these principles, and at length passed a
sentence of deposition against Pope Eugenius IV. Eugenius,
however, succeeded in maintaining his power, and at the council
of Florence (1439) secured the condemnation of the conciliar
theory; and this was reiterated still more emphatically, on the
eve of the Reformation, by the fifth Lateran council (1516).
Thenceforward the absolutist theories of the 13th and 14th
centuries increasingly dominated the Roman Church. The
popes so distrusted oecumenical councils that between 1517 and
1869 they called but one; at this (Trent, 1545-1563), however,
all treatment of the question of papal versus conciliar authority
was purposely avoided. Although the Declaration of the French
clergy of 1682 reaffirmed the conciliar doctrines of Constance,
since the French Revolution this &ldquo;Gallicanism&rdquo; has shown
itself to be but a passing phase of constitutional theory; and in
the 19th century the ascendancy of Ultramontanism became so
secure that Pius IX. could confidently summon to the Vatican a
synod which set its seal on the doctrine of papal infallibility. Yet
it would be a misconception to suppose that the Vatican decrees
mean the surrender of the ancient belief in the infallibility of
oecumenical synods; their decisions may still be regarded as
more solemn and more impressive than those of the pope alone;
their authority is fuller, though not higher. At present it is
agreed that the pope has the sole right of summoning oecumenical
councils, of presiding or appointing presidents and of determining
the order of business and the topics which shall come up. The
papal confirmation is indispensable; it is conceived of as the
stamp without which the expression of conciliar opinion lacks
legal validity. In other words, the oecumenical council is now
practically in the position of the senate of an absolute monarch.
It is in fact an open question whether a council is to be ranked as
really oecumenical until after its decrees have been approved by the
pope. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vatican Council</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ultramontanism</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infallibility</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The earlier oecumenical councils have well been called &ldquo;the
pitched battles of church history.&rdquo; Summoned to combat
heresy and schism, in spite of degrading pressure from without
and tumultuous disorder within, they ultimately brought about
a modicum of doctrinal agreement. On the one side as time went
on they bound scholarship hand and foot in the winding-sheet of
tradition, and also fanned the flames of intolerance; yet on the
other side they fostered the sense of the Church&rsquo;s corporate
oneness. The diocesan and provincial synods have formed a
valuable system of regularly recurring assemblies for disposing of
ecclesiastical business. They have been held most frequently,
however, in times of stress and of reform, for instance in the 11th,
16th and 19th centuries; at other periods they have lapsed into
disuse: it is significant that to-day the prelate who neglects to
convene them suffers no penalty. At present the main function
of both provincial and oecumenical synods seems to be to facilitate
obedience to the wishes of the central government of the Church.</p>

<p>The <i>right to vote</i> (<i>votum definitivum</i>) has been distinguished
from early times from the right to be heard (<i>votum consultativum</i>).
The Reform Synods of the 15th century gave a decisive vote to
doctors and licentiates of theology and of laws, some of them
sitting as individuals, some as representatives of universities.
Roman Catholic canonists now confine the right to vote at
oecumenical councils to bishops, cardinal deacons, generals or
vicars general of monastic orders and the <i>praelati nullius</i> (exempt
abbots, &amp;c.); all other persons, lay or clerical, who are admitted
or invited, have merely the <i>votum consultativum</i>&mdash;they are
chiefly procurators of absent bishops, or very learned priests.
It was but a clumsy and temporary expedient, designed to offset
the preponderance of Italian bishops dependent on the pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
when the council of Constance subdivided itself into several
groups or &ldquo;nations,&rdquo; each of which had a single vote. In
voting, the simple majority decides; yet such is the importance
attached to a unanimous verdict that an irreconcilable minority
may absent itself from the final vote, as was the case at the
Vatican Council.</p>

<p>The numbering of oecumenical synods is not fixed; the list
most used in the Roman Church to-day is that of Hefele (<i>Conciliengeschichte</i>,
2nd ed., I. 59 f.):</p>

<p class="noind">(Each of these and certain other important synods are treated in
separate articles.)</p>

<p>By including Pisa (1409) and by treating Florence as a separate
synod, certain writers have brought the number of oecumenical
councils up to twenty-two. These standard lists are of the type
which became established through the authority of Cardinal
R. F. Bellarmine (1542-1621), who criticized Constance and
Basel, while defending Florence and the fifth Lateran council
against the Gallicans. As late as the 16th century, however,
&ldquo;the majority did not regard those councils in which the Greek
Church did not take part as oecumenical at all&rdquo; (Harnack,
<i>History of Dogma</i>, vi. 17). The Greek Church accepts only the
first seven synods as oecumenical; and it reckons the Trullan
synod of 692 (the Quinisextum) as a continuation of the sixth
oecumenical synod of 680. But concerning the first seven
councils it should be remarked that Constantinople I. was but a
general synod of the East; its claim to oecumenicity rests upon
its reception by the West about two centuries later. Similarly
the only representatives of the West present at Constantinople II.
were certain Africans; the pope did not accept the decrees till
afterwards and they made their way in the West but gradually.
Just as there have been synods which have come to be considered
oecumenical though not convoked as such, so there have been
synods which though summoned as oecumenical, failed of
recognition: for instance Sardica (343), Ephesus (449), Constantinople
(754). The last two received the imperial confirmation
and from the legal point of view were no whit inferior to the
others; their decrees, however, were overthrown by subsequent
synods. As the Protestant leaders of the 16th century held fast
the traditional christology, they regarded with veneration the
dogmatic decisions of Nicaea I., Constantinople I., Ephesus and
Chalcedon. These four councils had enjoyed a more or less
fortuitous pre-eminence both in Roman and in canon law, and by
many Catholics at the time of the Reformation were regarded,
along with the three great creeds (Apostles&rsquo;, Nicene, Athanasian),
as a sort of irreducible minimum of orthodoxy. In the 17th
century the liberal Lutheran George Calixtus based his attempts
at reuniting Christendom on this <i>consensus quinquesaecularis</i>.
Many other Protestants have accepted Constantinople II. and
III. as supporting the first four councils; and still others,
notably many Anglican high churchmen, have felt bound by all
the oecumenical synods of the undivided Church. The common
Protestant attitude toward synods is, however, that they may
err and have erred, and that the Scriptures and not conciliar
decisions are the sole infallible standard of faith, morals and
worship.</p>

<p><i>Protestant Councils.</i>&mdash;The churches of the Reformation have all
had a certain measure of synodal life. The Church of England
has maintained its ancient provincial synods or convocations,
though for the greater part of the 18th and the first part of the
19th centuries they transacted no business. In the Lutheran
churches of Germany there was no strong agitation in favour of
introducing synods until the 19th century, when a movement,
designed to render the churches less dependent on the governmental
consistories, won its way, until at length Prussia itself
fell into line (1873 and 1876). As the powers granted to the
German synods are very limited, many of their advocates have
been disillusioned; but the Lutheran churches of America,
being independent of the state, have developed synods both
numerous and potent. In the Reformed churches outside
Germany synodal life is vigorous; its forms were developed by
the Huguenots in days of persecution, and passed thence to
Scotland and other presbyterian countries. Even many of the
churches of congregational polity have organized national
councils (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Congregationalism</a></span>); but here the principle of the
independence of the local church prevents the decisions from
binding those congregations which do not approve of the decrees.
Moreover, in the last decade of the 19th century a growing
desire for a rapprochement between the Free Churches in the
United Kingdom as a whole led to the annual assembly of the
Free Church Council for the consideration of all matters affecting
the dissenting bodies. This body has no executive or doctrinal
authority and is rather a conference than a council. In general
it may be said that synods are becoming more and more powerful
in Protestant lands, and that they are destined to still greater
prominence because of the growing sentiment for Christian
unity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUNCIL BLUFFS,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Pottawattamie
county, Iowa, U.S.A., about 2½ m. E. of the Missouri river
opposite Omaha, Nebraska, with which it is connected by a road
bridge and two railway bridges. Pop. (1890) 21,474; (1900)
25,802, of whom 3723 were foreign-born; (1910) 29,292. It
is pre-eminently a railway centre, being served by the Union
Pacific, of which it is the principal eastern terminus, the Chicago,
Burlington &amp; Quincy, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; Saint Paul, the
Chicago &amp; Northwestern, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific,
the Chicago Great-Western, the Illinois Central, and the Wabash,
which together have given it considerable commercial importance.
It is built for the most part on level ground at the foot of high
bluffs; and has several parks, the most attractive of which,
commanding fine views, is Fairmount Park. With the exception
of bricks and tiles, carriages and wagons, agricultural implements,
and the products of its railway shops, its manufactures are
relatively unimportant, the factory product in 1905 being valued
at only $1,924,109. Council Bluffs is the seat of the Western
Iowa Business College, and of the Iowa school for the deaf.
On or near the site of Council Bluffs, in 1804, Lewis and Clark
held a council with the Indians, whence the city&rsquo;s name. In
1838 the Federal government made this the headquarters of the
Pottawattamie Indians, removed from Missouri. They remained
until 1846-1847, when the Mormons came, built many cabins,
and named the place Kanesville. The Mormons remained only
about five years, but on their departure for Utah their places
were speedily taken by new immigrants. During 1849-1850
Council Bluffs became an important outfitting point for California
gold seekers&mdash;the goods being brought by boat from Saint
Louis&mdash;and in 1853 it was incorporated as a city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUNSEL AND COUNSELLOR,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> one who gives advice, more
particularly in legal matters. The term &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; is employed
in England as a synonym for a barrister-at-law, and may refer
either to a single person who pleads a cause, or collectively, to the
body of barristers engaged in a case. Counsellor or, more fully,
counsellor-at-law, is practically an obsolete term in England, but
is still in use locally in Ireland as an equivalent to barrister. In
the United States, a counsellor-at-law is, specifically, an attorney
admitted to practice in all the courts; but as there is no formal
distinction of the legal profession into two classes, as in England,
the term is more often used loosely in the same sense as &ldquo;lawyer,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> one who is versed in, or practises law.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUNT<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (Lat. <i>comes</i>, gen. <i>comitis</i>, Fr. <i>comte</i>, Ital. <i>conte</i>, Span.
<i>conde</i>), the English translation of foreign titles equivalent
generally to the English &ldquo;earl.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1b" id="FnAnchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In Anglo-French documents
the word <i>counte</i> was at all times used as the equivalent of earl, but,
unlike the feminine form &ldquo;countess,&rdquo; it did not find its way into
the English language until the 16th century, and then only in the
sense defined above. The title of earl, applied by the English to
the foreign counts established in England by William the
Conqueror, is dealt with elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Earl</a></span>). The present
article deals with (1) the office of count in the Roman empire
and the Frankish kingdom, (2) the development of the feudal
count in France and under the Holy Roman Empire, (3) modern
counts.</p>

<p>1. The Latin <i>comes</i> meant literally a companion or follower. In
the early Roman empire the word was used to designate the
companions of the emperor (<i>comites principis</i>) and so became a
title of honour. The emperor Hadrian chose senators as companions
on his travels and to help him in public business. They
formed a permanent council, and Hadrian&rsquo;s successors entrusted
these <i>comites</i> with the administration of justice and finance, or
placed them in military commands. The designation <i>comes</i> thus
developed into a formal official title of high officers of state, some
qualification being added to indicate the special duties attached
to the office in each case. Thus in the 5th century, among the
<i>comites</i> attached to the emperor&rsquo;s establishment, we find, <i>e.g.</i>, the
<i>comes sacrarum largitionum</i> and the <i>comes rei privatae</i>; while
others, forming the council, were styled <i>comites consistorii</i>.
Others were sent into the provinces as governors, <i>comites per
provincias constituti</i>; thus in the <i>Notitia dignitatum</i> we find a
<i>comes Aegypti</i>, a <i>comes Africae</i>, a <i>comes Belgicae</i>, a <i>comes
Lugdunensis</i> and others. Two of the generals of the Roman
province of Britain were styled the <i>comes Britanniae</i> and the
<i>comes littoris Saxonici</i> (count of the Saxon shore).</p>

<p>At Constantinople in the latter Roman empire the Latin word
<i>comes</i> assumed a Greek garb as <span class="grk" title="komês">&#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#962;</span> and was declined as a
Greek noun (gen. <span class="grk" title="komêtos">&#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>); the <i>comes sacrarum largitionum</i>
(count of the sacred bounties) was called at Constantinople
<span class="grk" title="ho komês tôn sakrôn largitiônôn">&#8001; &#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#974;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> and the <i>comes rerum privatarum</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
(count of the private estates) was called <span class="grk" title="komês tôn pribatôn">&#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>.
The count of the sacred bounties was the lord treasurer or
chancellor of the exchequer, for the public treasury and the
imperial fisc had come to be identical; while the count of the
private estates managed the imperial demesnes and the privy
purse. In the 5th century the &ldquo;sacred bounties&rdquo; corresponded
to the <i>aerarium</i> of the early Empire, while the <i>res privatae</i>
represented the fisc. The officers connected with the palace and
the emperor&rsquo;s person included the count of the wardrobe (<i>comes
sacrae vestis</i>), the count of the residence (<i>comes domorum</i>), and,
most important of all, the <i>comes domesticorum et sacri stabuli</i>
(graecized as <span class="grk" title="komês tou stablou">&#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#965;</span>). The count of the stable,
originally the imperial master of the horse, developed into the
&ldquo;illustrious&rdquo; commander-in-chief of the imperial army (Stilicho,
<i>e.g.</i>, bore the full title as given above), and became the prototype
of the medieval constable (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>An important official of the second rank (<i>spectabilis</i>, &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;
as contrasted with those of highest rank who were
&ldquo;illustrious&rdquo;) was the count of the East, who appears to have had
the control of a department in which 600 officials were engaged.
His power was reduced in the 6th century, when he was deprived
of his authority over the Orient diocese, and became civil
governor of Syria Prima, retaining his &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; rank.
Another important officer of the later Roman court was the
<i>comes sacri patrimonii</i>, who was instituted by the emperor
Anastasius. In this connexion it should be observed that the
word <i>patrimonium</i> gradually changed in meaning. In the beginning
of the 3rd century <i>patrimonium</i> meant crown property,
and <i>res privata</i> meant personal property: at the beginning of the
6th century <i>patrimonium</i> meant personal property, and <i>res
privata</i> meant crown property. It is difficult to give briefly a
clear idea of the functions of the three important officials <i>comes
sacrarum largitionum</i>, <i>comes rei privatae</i> and <i>comes sacri</i> <span class="correction" title="amended from partrimonii"><i>patrimonii</i></span>;
but the terms have been well translated by a German
author as <i>Finanzminister des Reichsschatzes</i> (finance minister of
the treasury of the Empire), <i>F. des Kronschatzes</i> (of the crown
treasury), and <i>F. des kaiserlichen Privatvermögens</i> (of the
emperor&rsquo;s private property).</p>

<p>The Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty retained the
Roman system of administration, and under them the word
<i>comes</i> preserved its original meaning; the <i>comes</i> was a companion
of the king, a royal servant of high rank. Under the early
Frankish kings some <i>comites</i> did not exercise any definite
functions; they were merely attached to the king&rsquo;s person and
executed his orders. Others filled the highest offices, <i>e.g.</i> the
<i>comes palatii</i> and <i>comes stabuli</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constable</a></span>). The kingdom
was divided for administrative purposes into small areas called
<i>pagi</i> (<i>pays</i>, Ger. <i>Gau</i>), corresponding generally to the Roman
<i>civitates</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">City</a></span>).<a name="FnAnchor_2b" id="FnAnchor_2b" href="#Footnote_2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> At the head of the <i>pagus</i> was the <i>comes</i>,
corresponding to the German <i>Graf</i> (<i>Gaugraf</i>, cf. Anglo-Saxon
<i>scire-gerefa</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_3b" id="FnAnchor_3b" href="#Footnote_3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a> sheriff). The <i>comes</i> was appointed by the king and
removable at his pleasure, and was chosen originally from all
classes, sometimes from enfranchised slaves. His essential
functions were judicial and executive, and in documents he is
often described as the king&rsquo;s agent (<i>agens publicus</i>) or royal
judge (<i>judex publicus</i> or <i>fiscalis</i>). As the delegate of the executive
power he had the right to military command in the king&rsquo;s name,
and to take all the measures necessary for the preservation of the
peace, <i>i.e.</i> to exercise the royal &ldquo;ban&rdquo; (<i>bannus regis</i>). He was at
once public prosecutor and judge, was responsible for the execution
of the sentences of the courts, and as the king&rsquo;s representative
exercised the royal right of protection (<i>mundium regis</i>) over
churches, widows, orphans and the like. He enjoyed a triple
wergeld, but had no definite salary, being remunerated by the
receipt of certain revenues, a system which contained the germs
of discord, on account of the confusion of his public and private
estates. He also retained a third of the fines which he imposed
in his judicial capacity.</p>

<p>Under the early Carolings the title count did not indicate noble
birth. A <i>comes</i> was generally raised from childhood in the king&rsquo;s
palace, and rose to be a count through successive stages. The
count&rsquo;s office was not yet a dignity, nor hereditary; he was not
independent nor appointed for life, but exercised the royal power
by delegation, as under the Merovingians. While, however, he
was theoretically paid by the king, he seems to have been
himself one of the sources of the royal revenue. The counties
were, it appears, farmed out; but in the 7th century the royal
choice became restricted to the larger landed proprietors, who
gradually emancipated themselves from royal control, and in the
8th century the term <i>comitatus</i> begins to denote a geographical
area, though there was little difference in its extent under the
Merovingian kings and the early Carolings. The count was
about to pass into the feudatory stage. Throughout the middle
ages, however, the original official and personal connotation of
the title was never wholly lost; or perhaps it would be truer to
say, with Selden, that it was early revived with the study of the
Roman civil law in the 12th century. The unique dignity of
count of the Lateran palace,<a name="FnAnchor_4b" id="FnAnchor_4b" href="#Footnote_4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> bestowed in 1328 by the emperor
Louis IV. the Bavarian on Castrucio de&rsquo; Antelminelli, duke of
Lucca, and his heirs male, was official as well as honorary,
being charged with the attendance and service to be performed
at the palace at the emperor&rsquo;s coronation at Rome (Du
Cange, s.v. <i>Comites Palatii Lateranensis</i>; Selden, op. cit. p. 321).
This instance, indeed, remained isolated; but the personal
title of &ldquo;count palatine,&rdquo; though honorary rather than official,
was conferred on officials&mdash;especially by the popes on those of
the Curia&mdash;had no territorial significance, and was to the last
reminiscent of those early comites palatii whose relations to the
sovereign had been purely personal and official (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palatine</a></span>).
A relic of the old official meaning of &ldquo;count&rdquo; still survives in
Transylvania, where the head of the political administration of
the Saxon districts is styled count (<i>comes</i>, <i>Graf</i>) of the Saxon
Nation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Feudal Counts.</i>&mdash;The process by which the official counts
were transformed into feudal vassals almost independent is
described in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Feudalism</a></span>. In the confusion of the
period of transition, when the title to possession was usually the
power to hold, designations which had once possessed a definite
meaning were preserved with no defined association. In France,
by the 10th century, the process of decomposition of the old
organization had gone far, and in the 11th century titles of
nobility were still very loosely applied. That of &ldquo;count&rdquo; was,
as Luchaire points out, &ldquo;equivocal&rdquo; even as late as the 12th
century; any castellan of moderate rank could style himself
<i>comte</i> who in the next century would have been called <i>seigneur</i>
(<i>dominus</i>). Even when, in the 13th century, the ranks of the
feudal hierarchy in France came to be more definitely fixed, the
style of &ldquo;count&rdquo; might imply much, or comparatively little.
In the oldest register of Philip Augustus counts are reckoned
with dukes in the first of the five orders into which the nobles are
divided, but the list includes, besides such almost sovereign
rulers as the counts of Flanders and Champagne, immediate
vassals of much less importance&mdash;such as the counts of Soissons
and Dammartin&mdash;and even one mediate vassal, the count of
Bar-sur-Seine. The title was still in fact &ldquo;equivocal,&rdquo; and so it
remained throughout French history. In the official lists it was
early placed second to that of duke (Luchaire, <i>Manuel</i>, p. 181,
note 1), but in practice at least the great <i>comtes-pairs</i> (<i>e.g.</i> of
Champagne) were the equals of any duke and the superiors of
many. Thus, too, in modern times royal princes have been given
the title of count (Paris, Flanders, Caserta), the heir of Charles X.
actually changing his style, without sense of loss, from that of duc
de Bordeaux to that of comte de Chambord. From the 16th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
century onwards the equivocal nature of the title in France was
increased by the royal practice of selling it, either to viscounts or
barons in respect of their fiefs, or to rich <i>roturiers</i>.</p>

<p>In Germany the change from the official to the territorial and
hereditary counts followed at the outset much the same course as
in France, though the later development of the title and its
meaning was different. In the 10th century the counts were
permitted by the kings to divide their benefices and rights
among their sons, the rule being established that countships
(<i>Grafschaften</i>) were hereditary, that they might be held by boys,
that they were heritable by females and might even be administered
by females. The <i>Grafschaft</i> became thus merely a
bundle of rights inherent in the soil; and, the count&rsquo;s office
having become his property, the old counties or <i>Gauen</i> rapidly
disappeared as administrative units, being either amalgamated or
subdivided. By the second half of the 12th century the official
character of the count had quite disappeared; he had become a
territorial noble, and the foundation had been laid of territorial
sovereignty (<i>Landeshoheit</i>). The first step towards this was the
concession to the counts of the military prerogatives of dukes,
a right enjoyed from the first by the counts of the marches (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Margrave</a></span>), then given to counts palatine (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palatine</a></span>) and,
finally, to other counts, who assumed by reason of it the style of
landgrave (<i>Landgraf</i>, <i>i.e.</i> count of a province). At first all counts
were reckoned as princes of the Empire (<i>Reichsfürsten</i>); but
since the end of the 12th century this rank was restricted to those
who were immediate tenants of the crown,<a name="FnAnchor_5b" id="FnAnchor_5b" href="#Footnote_5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the other counts of
the Empire (<i>Reichsgrafen</i>) being placed among the free lords
(<i>barones</i>, <i>liberi domini</i>). Counts of princely rank (<i>gefürstete
Grafen</i>) voted among the princes in the imperial diet; the others
(<i>Reichsgrafen</i>) were grouped in the <i>Grafenbänke</i>&mdash;originally two,
to which two more were added in the 17th century&mdash;each of
which had one vote. In 1806, on the formation of the Confederation
of the Rhine, the sovereign counts were all mediatized (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mediatization</a></span>). Even before the end of the Empire (1806)
the right of bestowing the title of count was freely exercised by
the various German territorial sovereigns.</p>

<p>3. <i>Modern Counts.</i>&mdash;Any political significance which the feudal
title of count retained in the 18th century vanished with the
changes produced by the Revolution. It is now simply a title of
honour and one, moreover, the social value of which differs
enormously, not only in the different European countries, but
within the limits of the same country. In Germany, for instance,
there are several categories of counts: (1) the mediatized princely
counts (<i>gefürstete Grafen</i>), who are reckoned the equals in blood
of the European sovereign houses, an equality symbolized by
the &ldquo;closed crown&rdquo; surmounting their armorial bearings. The
heads of these countly families of the &ldquo;high nobility&rdquo; are
entitled (by a decree of the federal diet, 1829) to the style of
<i>Erlaucht</i> (illustrious, most honourable); (2) Counts of the
Empire<a name="FnAnchor_6b" id="FnAnchor_6b" href="#Footnote_6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> (<i>Reichsgrafen</i>), descendants of those counts who,
before the end of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), were <i>Reichsständisch</i>
<i>i.e.</i> sat in one of the <i>Grafenbänke</i> in the imperial diet,
and entitled to a ducal coronet; (3) Counts (a) descended from
the lower nobility of the old Empire, titular since the 15th
century, (b) created since; their coronet is nine-pointed (cf. the
nine points and strawberry leaves of the English earl). The
difficulty of determining in any case the exact significance of
the title of a German count, illustrated by the above, is increased
by the fact that the title is generally heritable by all male
descendants, the only exception being in Prussia, where, since
1840, the rule of primogeniture has prevailed and the bestowal of
the title is dependent on a rent-roll of £3000 a year. The result
is that the title is very widespread and in itself little significant.
A German or Austrian count may be a wealthy noble of princely
rank, a member of the Prussian or Austrian Upper House, or he
may be the penniless cadet of a family of no great rank or
antiquity. Nevertheless the title, which has long been very
sparingly bestowed, always implies a good social position. The
style <i>Altgraf</i> (old count), occasionally found, is of some antiquity,
and means that the title of count has been borne by the family
from time immemorial.</p>

<p>In medieval France the significance of the title of count varied
with the power of those who bore it; in modern France it varies
with its historical associations. It is not so common as in
Germany or Italy; because it does not by custom pass to all
male descendants. The title was, however, cheapened by its
revival under Napoleon. By the decree of the 1st of March 1808,
reviving titles of nobility, that of count was assigned <i>ex officio</i> to
ministers, senators and life councillors of state, to the president of
the Corps Législatif and to archbishops. The title was made
heritable in order of primogeniture, and in the case of archbishops
through their nephews. These Napoleonic countships, increased
under subsequent reigns, have produced a plentiful crop of titles
of little social significance, and have tended to lower the status of
the counts deriving from the <i>ancien régime</i>. The title of marquis,
which Napoleon did not revive, has risen proportionately in the
estimation of the Faubourg St Germain. As for that of count, it
is safe to say that in France its social value is solely dependent on
its historical associations.</p>

<p>Of all European countries Italy has been most prolific of counts.
Every petty Italian prince, from the pope downwards, created
them for love or money; and, in the absence of any regulating
authority, the title was also widely and loosely assumed, while
often the feudal title passed with the sale of the estate to which it
was attached. Casanova remarked that in some Italian cities
all the nobles were <i>baroni</i>, in others all were <i>conti</i>. An Italian
<i>conte</i> may or may not be a gentleman; he has long ceased,
<i>qua</i> count, to have any social prestige, and his rank is not recognized
by the Italian government. As in France, however,
there are some Italian <i>conti</i> whose titles are respectable, and
even illustrious, from their historic associations. The prestige
belongs, however, not to the title but to the name. As for the
papal countships, which are still freely bestowed on those of all
nations whom the Holy See wishes to reward, their prestige
naturally varies with the religious complexion of the country in
which the titles are borne. They are esteemed by the faithful, but
have small significance for those outside. In Spain, on the other
hand, the title of <i>conde</i>, the earlier history of which follows much
the same development as in France, is still of much social value,
mainly owing to the fact that the rule of primogeniture exists,
and that, a large fee being payable to the state on succession to
a title, it is necessarily associated with some degree of wealth.
The Spanish counts of old creation, some of whom are grandees
and members of the Upper House, naturally take the highest
rank; but the title, still bestowed for eminent public services or
other reasons, is of value. The title, like others in Spain, can
pass through an heiress to her husband. In Russia the title of
count (<i>graf</i>, fem. <i>grafinya</i>), a foreign importation, has little social
prestige attached to it, being given to officials of a certain rank.
In the British empire the only recognized counts are those of
Malta, who are given precedence with baronets of the United
Kingdom.</p>

to be equivalent to English earls; but &ldquo;earl&rdquo; is always translated
by foreigners by words (<i>comte</i>, <i>Graf</i>) which in English are represented
by &ldquo;count,&rdquo; itself never used as the synonym of &ldquo;earl.&rdquo; Conversely
old English writers had no hesitation in translating as

<p><span class="bold">COUNTER<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span>. (1) (Through the O. Fr. <i>conteoir</i>, modern <i>comptoir</i>,
from Lat. <i>computare</i>, to reckon), a round piece of metal, wood or
other material used anciently in making calculations, and now for
reckoning points in games of cards, &amp;c., or as tokens representing
actual coins or sums of money in gambling games such as roulette.
The word is thus used, figuratively, of something of no real value,
a sham. In the original sense of &ldquo;a means of counting money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
or keeping accounts,&rdquo; &ldquo;counter&rdquo; is used of the table or flat-topped
barrier in a bank, merchant&rsquo;s office or shop, on which
money is counted and goods handed to a customer. The term
was also applied, usually in the form &ldquo;compter,&rdquo; to the debtors&rsquo;
prisons attached to the mayor&rsquo;s or sheriff&rsquo;s courts in London and
some other boroughs in England. The &ldquo;compters&rdquo; of the
sheriff&rsquo;s courts of the city of London were, at various times, in
the Poultry, Bread St., Wood St. and Giltspur St.; the Giltspur
St. compter was the last to be closed, in 1854. (2) (From Lat.
<i>contra</i>, opposite, against), a circular parry in fencing, and in
boxing, a blow given as a parry to a lead of an opponent. The
word is also used of the stiff piece of leather at the back of a boot
or shoe, of the rounded angle at the stern of a ship, and, in a
horse, of the part lying between the shoulder and the under part
of the neck. In composition, counter is used to express contrary
action, as in &ldquo;countermand,&rdquo; &ldquo;counterfeit,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUNTERFEITING<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>contra-facere</i>, to make in
opposition or contrast), making an imitation without authority
and for the purpose of defrauding. The word is more particularly
used in connexion with the making of imitations of money,
whether paper or coin. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coinage Offences</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Forgery</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUNTERFORT<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (Fr. <i>contrefort</i>), in architecture, a buttress or

feature inside.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUNTERPOINT<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (Lat. <i>contrapunctus</i>, &ldquo;point counter point,&rdquo;
&ldquo;note against note&rdquo;), in music, the art happily defined by Sir
Frederick Gore Ouseley as that &ldquo;of combining&rdquo; melodies: this
should imply that good counterpoint is the production of beautiful
harmony by a combination of well-characterized melodies.
The individual audibility of the melodies is a matter of which
current criticism enormously overrates the importance. What is
always important is the peculiar life breathed into harmony by
contrapuntal organization. Both historically and aesthetically
&ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; are inextricably blended; for
nearly every harmonic fact is in its origin a phenomenon of
counterpoint. And if in later musical developments it becomes
possible to treat chords as, so to speak, harmonic lumps with a
meaning independent of counterpoint, this does not mean that
they have really changed their nature; but it shows a difference
between modern and earlier music precisely similar to that between
modern English, in which metaphorical and abstract expressions
are so constantly used that they have become a mere shorthand
for the literal and concrete expression, and classical Greek, where
metaphors and abstractions can appear only as elaborate
similes or explicit philosophical ideas. The laws of counterpoint
are, then, laws of harmony with the addition of such laws of
melody as are not already produced by the interaction of
harmonic and melodic principles. In so far as the laws of
counterpoint are derived from purely harmonic principles, that is
to say, derived from the properties of concord and discord, their
origin and development are discussed in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span>.
In so far as they depend entirely on melody they are too minute
and changeable to admit of general discussion; and in so far as
they show the interaction of melodic and harmonic principles it is
more convenient to discuss them under the head of harmony,
because they appear in such momentary phenomena as are more
easily regarded as successions of chords than as principles of
design. All that remains, then, for the present article is the
explanation of certain technical terms.</p>

<p>1. <i>Canto Fermo</i> (<i>i.e.</i> plain chant) is a melody in long notes
given to one voice while others accompany it with quicker
counterpoints (the term &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; in this connexion
meaning accompanying melodies). In the simplest cases the
<i>Canto Fermo</i> has notes of equal length and is unbroken in flow.
When it is broken up and its rhythm diversified, the gradations
between counterpoint on a <i>Canto Fermo</i> and ordinary forms of
polyphony, or indeed any kind of melody with an elaborate
accompaniment, are infinite and insensible.</p>

<p>2. <i>Double Counterpoint</i> is a combination of melodies so designed
that either can be taken above or below the other. When this
change of position is effected by merely altering the octave of
either or both melodies (with or without transposition of the
whole combination to another key), the artistic value of the
device is simply that of the raising of the lower melody to the
surface. The harmonic scheme remains the same, except in so far
as some of the chords are not in their fundamental position, while
others, not originally fundamental, have become so. But double
counterpoint may be in other intervals than the octave; that is
to say, while one of the parts remains stationary, the other may
be transposed above or below it by some interval other than an
octave, thus producing an entirely different set of harmonies.</p>

<p><i>Double Counterpoint in the 12th</i> has thus been made a powerful
means of expression and variety. The artistic value of this
device depends not only on the beauty and novelty of the second
scheme of harmony obtained, but also on the change of melodic
expression produced by transferring one of the melodies to
another position in the scale. Two of the most striking illustrations
of this effect are to be found in the last chorus of Brahms&rsquo;s
<i>Triumphlied</i> and in the fourth of his variations on a theme by
Haydn.</p>

<p><i>Double Counterpoint in the 10th</i> has, in addition to this, the
property that the inverted melody can be given in the new and in
the original positions simultaneously.</p>

<p>Double counterpoint in other intervals than the octave, 10th
and 12th, is rare, but the general principle and motives for it
remain the same under all conditions. The two subjects of the
<i>Confiteor</i> in Bach&rsquo;s B minor Mass are in double counterpoint in
the octave, 11th and 13th. And Beethoven&rsquo;s Mass in D is full of
pieces of double counterpoint in the inversions of which a few
notes are displaced so as to produce momentary double counterpoint
in unusual intervals, obviously with the intention of
varying the harmony. Technical treatises are silent as to this
purpose, and leave the student in the belief that the classical
composers used these devices, if at all, in a manner as meaningless
as the examples in the treatises.</p>

<p>3. <i>Triple, Quadruple and Multiple Counterpoint.</i>&mdash;When more
than two melodies are designed so as to combine in interchangeable
positions, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid chords
and progressions of which some inversions are incorrect. In
triple counterpoint this difficulty is not so great; although a
complete triad is dangerous, as it is apt to invert as a &ldquo;6/4<span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>&rdquo;
which requires careful handling. On the other hand, in triple
counterpoint the necessity for strictness is at its greatest,
because there are only six possible inversions, and in a long
polyphonic work most of these will be required. Moreover, the
artistic value of the device is at its highest in three-part polyphonic
harmony, which, whether invertible or not, is always a
fine test of artistic economy, while the inversions are as evident
to the ear, especially where the top part is concerned, as those
in double counterpoint. Triple counterpoint (and a fortiori
multiple counterpoint) is normally possible only at the octave;
for it will be found that if three parts are designed to invert in
some other interval this will involve two of them inverting in a
third interval which will give rise to incalculable difficulty.
This makes the fourth of Brahms&rsquo;s variations on a theme of
Haydn almost miraculous. The plaintive expression of the whole
variation is largely due to the fact that the flowing semiquaver
counterpoint below the main theme is on each repeat inverted in
the 12th, with the result that its chief emphasis falls upon the
most plaintive parts of the scale. But in the first eight bars of
the second part of the variation a third contrapuntal voice
appears, and this too is afterwards inverted in the 12th, with
perfectly natural and smooth effect. But this involves the
inversion of two of the counterpoints with each other in the 9th,
a kind of double counterpoint which is almost impossible. The
case is unique, but it admirably illustrates the difference between
artistic and merely academic mastery of technical resource.</p>

<p><i>Quadruple Counterpoint</i> is not rare with Bach. It would be
more difficult than triple, but for the fact that of its twenty-four
possible inversions not more than four or five need be correct.
<i>Quintuple counterpoint</i> is admirably illustrated in the finale of
Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Jupiter Symphony</i>, in which everything in the successive
statement and gradual development of the five themes conspires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
to give the utmost effect to their combination in the coda. Of
course Mozart has not room for more than five of the 120 possible
combinations, and from these he selects such as bring fresh
themes into the outside parts, which are the most clearly audible.
<i>Sextuple Counterpoint</i> may be found in Bach&rsquo;s great double
chorus, <i>Nun ist das Heil</i>, and in the finale of his concerto for
three claviers in C, and probably in other places.</p>

<p>4. <i>Added Thirds and Sixths.</i>&mdash;An easy and effective imitation
of triple and quadruple counterpoint, embodying much of the
artistic value of inversion, is found in the numerous combinations
of themes in thirds and sixths which arise from an extension of
the principle which we mentioned in connexion with double
counterpoint in the 10th, namely, the possibility of performing
it in its original and inverted positions simultaneously. The
<i>Pleni sunt coeli</i> of Bach&rsquo;s B minor Mass is written in this kind of
transformation of double into quadruple counterpoint; and the
artistic value of the device is perhaps never so magnificently
realized as in the place, at bar 84, where the trumpet doubles the
bass three octaves and a third above while the alto and second
tenor have the counter subjects in close thirds in the middle.</p>

<p>Almost all other contrapuntal devices are derived from the
principle of the <i>canon</i> and are discussed in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Contrapuntal
Forms</a></span>.</p>

<p>As a training in musical grammar and style, the rhythms of
16th-century polyphony were early codified into &ldquo;the five
species of counterpoint&rdquo; (with various other species now forgotten)
and practised by students of composition. The classical
treatise on which Haydn and Beethoven were trained was Fux&rsquo;s
<i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i> (1725). This was superseded in the 19th
century by Cherubini&rsquo;s, the first of a long series of attempts to
bring up to date as a dead language what should be studied in its
original and living form.</p>

opposite, over against, thus the tract of land which fronts the
sight, cf. Ger. <i>Gegend</i>, neighbourhood), an extent of land without
definite limits, or such a region with some peculiar character, as
the &ldquo;black country,&rdquo; the &ldquo;fen country&rdquo; and the like. The
extension from such descriptive limitation to the limitation of
occupation by particular owners or races is easy; this gives the
common use of the word for the land inhabited by a particular
nation or race. Another meaning is that part of the land not

this appears too in &ldquo;country-house&rdquo; and &ldquo;country town&rdquo;;
so too &ldquo;countryman&rdquo; is used both for a rustic and for the native

<p><span class="bold">COUNTY<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (through Norm. Fr. <i>counté</i>, cf. O. Fr. <i>cunté</i>, <i>conté</i>,
Mod. Fr. <i>comté</i>, from Lat. <i>comitatus</i>, cf. Ital. <i>comitato</i>, Prov. <i>comtat</i>;
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Count</a></span>), in its most usual sense the name given to certain
important administrative divisions in the United Kingdom, the
British dominions beyond the seas, and the United States of
America. The word was first introduced after the Norman
Conquest as the equivalent of the old English &ldquo;shire,&rdquo; which has
survived as its synonym, though occasionally also applied to
divisions smaller than counties, <i>e.g.</i> Norhamshire, Hexhamshire
and Hallamshire. The word &ldquo;county&rdquo; is also sometimes used,
alternatively with &ldquo;countship,&rdquo; to translate foreign words,
<i>e.g.</i> the French <i>comté</i> and the German <i>Grafschaft</i>, which connote
the territorial jurisdiction of a count (<i>q.v.</i>). The present article
is confined to a sketch of the origin and development of English
counties, which have served in a greater or less degree as the
model for the county organizations in the various countries of the
English-speaking world which are described under their proper
headings.</p>

<p>About one-third of the English counties represent ancient
kingdoms, sub-kingdoms or tribal divisions, such as Kent,
Sussex, Norfolk, Devon; but most of the remaining counties
take their names from some important town within their respective
boundaries. The counties to the south of the Thames
(except Cornwall) already existed in the time of Alfred, but those
of the midlands seem to have been created during the reign of
Edward the Elder (901-925) and to have been artificially
bounded areas lying around some stronghold which became a
centre of civil and military administration. There is reason,
however, for thinking that the counties of Bedford, Cambridge,
Huntingdon and Northampton are of Danish origin.
Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were not
recognized as English counties until some time after the Norman
Conquest, the last two definitely appearing as fiscal areas in 1177.
The origin of Rutland as a county is obscure, but it had its own
sheriff in 1154.</p>

<p>In the period preceding the Norman Conquest two officers
appear at the head of the county organization. These are the
ealdorman or earl, and the <i>scirgerefa</i> or sheriff. The shires of
Wessex appear each to have had an ealdorman, whose duties
were to command its military forces, to preside over the county
assembly (<i>scirgemot</i>), to carry out the laws and to execute
justice. The name ealdorman gave way to that of earl, probably
under Danish influence, in the first half of the 11th century, and
it is probable that the office of sheriff came into existence in the
reign of Canute (1017-1035), when the great earldoms were
formed and it was no longer possible for the earl to perform his
various administrative duties in person in a group of counties.
After the Norman Conquest the earl was occasionally appointed
sheriff of his county, but in general his only official connexion
with it was to receive the third penny of its pleas, and the
earldom ceased to be an office and became merely a title. In the
12th century the office of coroner was created, two or more of
them being chosen in the county court as vacancies occurred.
In the same century verderers were first chosen in the same
manner for the purpose of holding inquisitions on vert and
venison in those counties which contained royal forests. It was
the business of the sheriff (<i>vicecomes</i>) as the king&rsquo;s representative
to serve and return all writs, to levy distresses on the king&rsquo;s
behalf, to execute all royal precepts and to collect the king&rsquo;s
revenue. In this work he was assisted by a large staff of clerks
and bailiffs who were directly responsible to him and not to the
king. The sheriff also commanded the armed forces of the crown
within his county, and either in person or by deputy presided
over the county court which was now held monthly in most
counties. In 1300 it was enacted that the sheriffs might be
chosen by the county, except in Worcestershire, Cornwall,
Rutland, Westmorland and Lancashire, where there were then
sheriffs in fee, that is, sheriffs who held their offices hereditarily
by royal grant. The elective arrangement was of no long
duration, and it was finally decided in 1340 that the sheriffs
should be appointed by the chancellor, the treasurer and the
chief baron of the exchequer, but should hold office for one year
only. The county was from an early period regarded as a
community, and approached the king as a corporate body, while
in later times petitions were presented through the knights of the
shire. It was also an organic whole for the purpose of the
conservation of the peace. The assessment of taxation by
commissioners appointed by the county court developed in the
13th century into the representation of the county by two knights
of the shire elected by the county court to serve in parliament,
and this representation continued unaltered save for a short
period during the Protectorate, until 1832, when many of the
counties received a much larger representation, which was still
further increased by later acts.</p>

<p>The royal control over the county was strengthened from the
14th century onward by the appointment of justices of the peace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
This system was further developed under the Tudors, while in the
middle of the 16th century the military functions of the sheriff
were handed over to a new officer, the lord-lieutenant, who is now
more prominently associated with the headship of the county
than is the sheriff. The lord-lieutenant now usually holds the
older office of <i>custos rotulorum</i>, or keeper of the records of the
county. The justices of the peace are appointed upon his
nomination, and until lately he appointed the clerk of the peace.
The latter appointment is now made by the joint committee of
quarter sessions and county council.</p>

<p>The Tudor system of local government received little alteration
until the establishment of county councils by the Local Government
Act of 1888 handed over to an elected body many of the
functions previously exercised by the nominated justices of the
peace. For the purposes of this act the ridings of Yorkshire, the
divisions of Lincolnshire, east and west Sussex, east and west
Suffolk, the soke of Peterborough and the Isle of Ely are regarded
as counties, so that there are now sixty administrative counties
of England and Wales. Between 1373 and 1692 the crown
granted to certain cities and boroughs the privilege of being
counties of themselves. There were in 1835 eighteen of these
counties corporate, Bristol, Chester, Coventry, Gloucester,
Lincoln, Norwich, Nottingham, York and Carmarthen, each of
which had two sheriffs, and Canterbury, Exeter, Hull, Lichfield,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Poole, Southampton, Worcester and
Haverfordwest, each of which had one sheriff. All these
boroughs, with the exception of Carmarthen, Lichfield, Poole and
Haverfordwest, which remain counties of themselves, and forty-seven
others, were created county boroughs by the Local Government
Act 1888, and are entirely dissociated from the control of
a county council. The City of London is also a county of itself,
whose two sheriffs are also sheriffs of Middlesex, while for the
purposes of the act of 1888 the house-covered district which
extends for many miles round the City constitutes a county.</p>

<p>The county has always been the unit for the organization of the
militia, and from about 1782 certain regiments of the regular
army were associated with particular counties by territorial
titles. The army scheme of 1907-1908 provided for the formation
of county associations under the presidency of the lords-lieutenant
for the organization of the new territorial army.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUNTY COURT,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> in England, a local court of civil jurisdiction.
The county court, it has been said, is at once the most ancient
and the most modern of English civil tribunals. The Saxon
Curia Comitatus, maintained after the Norman Conquest, was a
local court and a small debts court. It was instituted by Alfred
the Great, its jurisdiction embracing civil, and, until the reign of
William I., ecclesiastical matters. The officers of the court
consisted of the earldorman, the bishop and the sheriff. The
court was held once in every four weeks, being presided over by
the earl, or, in his absence, the sheriff. The suitors of the court,
<i>i.e.</i> the freeholders, were the judges, the sheriff being simply
a presiding officer, pronouncing and afterwards executing the
judgment of the court. The court was not one of record. The
appointment of judges of assize in the reign of Henry II., as well
as the expensive and dilatory procedure of the court, brought
about its gradual disuse, and other local courts, termed courts
of request or of conscience, were established. These, in turn,
proved unsatisfactory, owing both to the limited nature of their
jurisdiction (restricted to causes of debt not exceeding 40s. in
value, and to the fact that they were confined to particular places).
Accordingly, with the view of making justice cheaper and more
accessible the County Courts Act 1846 was passed. This act had
the modest title of &ldquo;An Act for the Recovery of Small Debts and
Demands in England.&rdquo; The original limit of the jurisdiction of
the new courts was £20, extended in 1850 to £50 in actions of
debt, and in 1903 (by an act which came into force in 1905)
to £100. Thirteen amending acts were passed, by which new
jurisdiction was from time to time conferred on the county
courts, and in the year 1888 an act was passed repealing the
previous acts and consolidating their provisions, with some
amendment. This is now the code or charter of the county courts.</p>

<p>The grain of mustard-seed sown in 1846 has grown into a
goodly tree, with branches extending over the whole of England
and Wales; and they embrace within their ambit a more
multifarious jurisdiction than is possessed by any other courts
in the kingdom. England and Wales were mapped out into 59
circuits (not including the city of London), with power for the
crown, by order in council, to abolish any circuit and rearrange
the areas comprised in the circuits (sec. 4). There is one
judge to each circuit, but the lord chancellor is empowered to
appoint two judges in a circuit, provided that the total number of
judges does not exceed 60. The salary of a county court judge
was originally fixed at £1200, but he now receives £1500. He
must at the time of his appointment be a barrister-at-law of at
least seven years&rsquo; standing, and not more than sixty years of age;
after appointment he cannot sit as a member of parliament or
practise at the bar.</p>

<p>Every circuit (except in Birmingham, Clerkenwell, and Westminster)
is divided into districts, in each of which there is a
court, with a registrar and bailiffs. The judges are directed to
attend and hold a court in each district at least once in every
month, unless the lord chancellor shall otherwise direct (secs.
10, 11). But in practice the judge sits several times a month in
the large centres of population, and less frequently than once a
month in the court town of sparsely inhabited districts. By sec.
185 of the act of 1888 the judges and officers of the city of London
court have the like jurisdiction, powers, and authority as those of
a county court, and the county court rules apply to that court.</p>

<p>The ordinary jurisdiction of the county courts may be thus
tabulated:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is no discoverable principle upon which these limits of the
jurisdiction of the county courts have been determined. But
the above table is not by any means an exhaustive statement of
the jurisdiction of the county courts. For many years it has been
the practice of parliament to throw on the county court judges
the duty of acting as judges or arbitrators for the purpose of new
legislation relating to social subjects. It is impossible to classify
the many statutes which have been passed since 1846 and which
confer some jurisdiction, apart from that under the County Courts
Act, on county courts or their judges. Some of these acts
impose exceptional duties on the judges of the county courts,
others confer unlimited jurisdiction concurrently with the High
Court or some other court, others, again, confer limited or,
sometimes, exclusive jurisdiction. A list of all the acts will be
found in the <i>Annual County Courts Practice</i>. A county court
judge may determine all matters of fact as well as law, but a jury
may be summoned at the option of either plaintiff or defendant
when the amount in dispute exceeds £5, and in actions under £5
the judge may in his discretion, on application of either of the
parties, order that the action be tried by jury. The number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
jurymen impanelled and sworn at the trial was, by the County
Courts Act 1903, increased from five to eight.</p>

<p>There is an appeal from the county courts on matters of law
to a divisional court of the High Court, <i>i.e.</i> to the admiralty
division in admiralty cases and to the king&rsquo;s bench division in
other cases (sec. 120 of act of 1888). The determination of the
divisional court is final, unless leave be given by that court or
the court of appeal (Judicature Acts 1894). (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Appeal</a></span>.)
In proceedings under the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act the
appeal from a county court judge is to the court of appeal, with
a subsequent appeal to the House of Lords. In 1908 a Committee
was appointed by the lord chancellor &ldquo;to inquire into certain
matters of county court procedure.&rdquo; The committee presented
a report in 1909 (H.C. 71), recommending the extension of
existing county court jurisdiction, but a bill introduced to give
effect to the recommendations was not proceeded with.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUPÉ<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (French for &ldquo;cut off&rdquo;), a small closed carriage of the
brougham type, with four wheels and seats for two persons;
the term is also used of the front compartment on a <i>diligence</i> or
mail-coach on the continent of Europe, and of a compartment in a
railway carriage with seats on one side only.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUPLET,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a pair of lines of verse, which are welded together
by an identity of rhyme. The <i>New English Dict.</i> derives the use
of the word from the French <i>couplet</i>, signifying two pieces of
iron riveted or hinged together. In rhymed verse two lines
which complete a meaning in themselves are particularly known
as a couplet. Thus, in Pope&rsquo;s <i>Eloisa to Abelard</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</p>
<p class="i05">And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In much of old English dramatic literature, when the mass of the
composition is in blank verse or even in prose, particular emphasis
is given by closing the scene in a couplet. Thus, in the last act
of Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>Thierry and Theodoret</i> the action
culminates in an unexpected rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;And now lead on; they that shall read this story</p>
<p class="i05">Shall find that virtue lives in good, not glory.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In French literature, the term couplet is not confined to a pair of
lines, but is commonly used for a stanza. A &ldquo;square&rdquo; couplet,
in French, for instance, is a strophe of eight lines, each composed
of eight syllables. In this sense it is employed to distinguish the
more emphatic parts of a species of verse which is essentially gay,
graceful and frivolous, such as the songs in a vaudeville or a
comic opera. In the 18th century, Le Sage, Piron and even
Voltaire did not hesitate to engage their talents on the production
of couplets, which were often witty, if they had no other merit,
and were well fitted to catch the popular ear. This signification
of the word <i>couplet</i> is not unknown in England, but it is not
customary; it is probably used in a stricter and a more technical
sense to describe a pair of rhymed lines, whether serious or merry.
The normal type, as it may almost be called, of English versification
is the metre of ten-syllabled rhymed lines designated as
<i>heroic couplet</i>. This form of iambic verse, with five beats to each
line, is believed to have been invented by Chaucer, who employs
it first in the Prologue <i>The Legend of Good Women</i> the
composition of which is attributed to the year 1385. That poem
opens with the couplet:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;A thousand times have I heard man tell</p>
<p class="i05">That there is joy in heaven and pain in hell.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">This is an absolutely correct example of the heroic couplet,
which ultimately reached such majesty in the hands of Dryden
and such brilliancy in those of Pope. It has been considered
proper for didactic, descriptive and satirical poetry, although in
the course of the 19th century blank verse largely took its place.
Epigram often selects the couplet as the vehicle of its sharpened
arrows, as in Sir John Harington&rsquo;s</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Treason doth never prosper: what&rsquo;s the reason?</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUPON<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>couper</i>, to cut), a certificate entitling its
owner to some payment, share or other benefit; more specifically,
one of a series of interest certificates or dividend warrants
attached to a bond running for a number of years. The word
coupon (a piece cut off) possesses an etymological meaning so
comprehensive that, while on the Stock Exchange it is only used
to denote such an interest certificate or a certificate of stock
of a joint-stock company, it may be as suitably, and elsewhere
is perhaps more frequently, applied to tickets sold by tourist
agencies and others. The coupons by means of which the interest
on a bond or debenture is collected are generally printed at the
side or foot of that document, to be cut off and presented for
payment at the bank or agency named on them as they become
due. The last portion, called a &ldquo;talon,&rdquo; is a form of certificate,
and entitles the holder, when all the coupons have been presented,
to obtain a fresh coupon sheet. They pass by delivery, and are as
a rule exempt from stamp duty. Coupons for the payment of
dividends are also attached to the share warrants to bearer
issued by some joint-stock companies. The coupons on the
bonds of most of the principal foreign loans are payable in
London in sterling as well as abroad.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURAYER, PIERRE FRANÇOIS LE<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1681-1776), French
Roman Catholic theological writer, was born at Rouen on the
17th of November 1681. While canon regular and librarian of
the abbey of St Geneviève at Paris, he conducted a correspondence
with Archbishop Wake on the subject of episcopal succession
in England, which supplied him with material for his work,
<i>Dissertation sur la validité des ordinations des Anglais et sur la
succession des évêques de l&rsquo;Église anglicane, avec les preuves
justificatives des faits avancés</i> (Brussels, 1723; Eng. trans. by
D. Williams, London, 1725; reprinted Oxford, 1844, with
memoir of the author), an attempt to prove that there has been
no break in the line of ordination from the apostles to the English
clergy. His opinions exposed him to a prosecution, and with the
help of Bishop Atterbury, then in exile in Paris, he took refuge
in England, where he was presented by the university of Oxford
with a doctor&rsquo;s degree. In 1736 he published a French translation
of Paolo Sarpi&rsquo;s <i>History of the Council of Trent</i>, and dedicated
it to Queen Caroline, from whom he received a pension of £200 a
year. Besides this he translated Sleidan&rsquo;s <i>History of the Reformation</i>,
and wrote several theological works. He died in London on
the 17th of October 1776, and was buried in the cloisters of
Westminster Abbey. In his will, dated two years before his
death, he declared himself still a member of the Roman Catholic
Church, although dissenting from many of its opinions.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURBET, GUSTAVE<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1819-1877), French painter, was born
at Ornans (Doubs) on the 10th of June 1819. He went to Paris
in 1839, and worked at the studio of Steuben and Hesse; but
his independent spirit did not allow him to remain there long, as
he preferred to work out his own way by the study of Spanish,
Flemish and French painters. His first works, an &ldquo;Odalisque,&rdquo;
suggested by Victor Hugo, and a &ldquo;Lélia,&rdquo; illustrating George
Sand, were literary subjects; but these he soon abandoned for
the study of real life. Among other works he painted his own
portrait with his dog, and &ldquo;The Man with a Pipe,&rdquo; both of which
were rejected by the jury of the Salon; but the younger school of
critics, the neo-romantics and realists, loudly sang the praises of
Courbet, who by 1849 began to be famous, producing such pictures
as &ldquo;After Dinner at Ornans&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Valley of the Loire.&rdquo;
The Salon of 1850 found him triumphant with the &ldquo;Burial at
Ornans,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Stone-Breakers&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Peasants of Flazey.&rdquo;
His style still gained in individuality, as in &ldquo;Village Damsels&rdquo;
(1852), the &ldquo;Wrestlers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bathers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Girl Spinning&rdquo;
(1852). Though Courbet&rsquo;s realistic work is not devoid of importance,
it is as a landscape and sea painter that he will be most
honoured by posterity. Sometimes, it must be owned, his
realism is rather coarse and brutal, but when he paints the
forests of Franche-Comté, the &ldquo;Stag-Fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wave,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Haunt of the Does,&rdquo; he is inimitable. When Courbet had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
made a name as an artist he grew ambitious of other glory; he
tried to promote democratic and social science, and under the
Empire he wrote essays and dissertations. His refusal of the
cross of the Legion of Honour, offered to him by Napoleon III.,
made him immensely popular, and in 1871 he was elected,
under the Commune, to the chamber. Thus it happened that he
was responsible for the destruction of the Vendôme column. A
council of war, before which he was tried, condemned him to pay
the cost of restoring the column, 300,000 francs (£12,000). To
escape the necessity of working to the end of his days at the orders
of the State in order to pay this sum, Courbet went to Switzerland
in 1873, and died at La Tour du Peilz, on the 31st of
December 1877, of a disease of the liver aggravated by intemperance.
An exhibition of his works was held in 1882 at the École
des Beaux-Arts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURCELLE-SENEUIL, JEAN GUSTAVE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1813-1892),
French economist, was born at Seneuil (Dordogne) on the 22nd of
December 1813. Seneuil was an additional name adopted from
his native place. Devoting himself at first to the study of the
law, he was called to the French bar in 1835. Soon after, however,
he returned to Dordogne and settled down as a manager of ironworks.
He found leisure to study economic and political
questions, and was a frequent contributor to the republican
papers. On the establishment of the second republic in 1848 he
became director of the public domains. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of
Napoleon III. in 1851 he went to South America, and held the
professorship of political economy at the National Institute of
Santiago, in Chile, from 1853 to 1863, when he returned to France.
In 1879 he was made a councillor of state, and in 1882 was elected
a member of the <i>Académie des sciences morales et politiques</i>. He
died at Paris on the 29th of June 1892. Courcelle-Seneuil, as an
economist, was strongly inclined towards the liberal school, and
was equally partial to the historical and experimental methods;
but his best energies were directed to applied economy and
social questions. His principal work is <i>Traité théorique et

may be mentioned <i>Traité théorique et pratique des opérations de

<p><span class="bold">COURCI, JOHN DE<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (d. 1219?), Anglo-Norman conqueror of
Ulster, was a member of a celebrated Norman family of Oxfordshire
and Somersetshire, whose parentage is unknown, and
around whose career a mass of legend has grown up. It would
appear that he accompanied William Fitz-Aldelm to Ireland
when the latter, after the death of Strongbow, was sent thither
by Henry II., and that he immediately headed an expedition from
Dublin to Ulster, where he took Downpatrick, the capital of the
northern kingdom. After some years of desultory fighting de
Courci established his power over that part of Ulster comprised
in the modern counties of Antrim and Down, throughout which
he built a number of castles, where his vassals, known as &ldquo;the
barons of Ulster,&rdquo; held sway over the native tribes. After the
accession of Richard I., de Courci in conjunction with William
de Lacy appears in some way to have offended the king by his
proceedings in Ireland. De Lacy quickly made his peace with
Richard, while de Courci defied him; and the subsequent history
of the latter consisted mainly in the vicissitudes of a lasting feud
with the de Lacys. In 1204 Hugh de Lacy utterly defeated de
Courci in battle, and took him prisoner. De Courci, however,
soon obtained his liberty, probably by giving hostages as security
for a promise of submission which he failed to carry out, seeking
an asylum instead with the O&rsquo;Neills of Tyrone. He again
appeared in arms on hearing that Hugh de Lacy had obtained a
grant of Ulster with the title of earl; and in alliance with the
king of Man he ravaged the territory of Down; but was completely
routed by Walter de Lacy, and disappeared from the scene
till 1207, when he obtained permission to return to England. In
1210 he was in favour with King John, from whom he received a
pension, and whom he accompanied to Ireland. There is some
indication of his having sided with John in his struggle with the
barons; but of the later history of de Courci little is known.
He probably died in the summer of 1219. Both de Courci and his
wife Affreca were benefactors of the church, and founded several
abbeys and priories in Ulster.</p>

<p>A story is told that de Courci when imprisoned in the Tower
volunteered to act as champion for King John in single combat
against a knight representing Philip Augustus of France; that
when he appeared in the lists his French opponent fled in panic;
whereupon de Courci, to gratify the French king&rsquo;s desire to
witness his prowess, &ldquo;cleft a massive helmet in twain at a single
blow,&rdquo; a feat for which he was rewarded by a grant of the
privilege for himself and his heirs to remain covered in the
presence of the king and all future sovereigns of England. This
tale, which still finds a place in Burke&rsquo;s <i>Peerage</i> in the account
of the baron Kingsale, a descendant of the de Courci family, is a
legend without historic foundation which did not obtain currency
till centuries after John de Courci&rsquo;s death. The statement that
he was created earl of Ulster, and that he was thus &ldquo;the first
Englishman dignified with an Irish title of honour,&rdquo; is equally
devoid of foundation. John de Courci left no legitimate
children.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURIER, PAUL LOUIS<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1773-1825), French Hellenist and
political writer, was born in Paris on the 4th of January 1773.
Brought up on his father&rsquo;s estate of Méré in Touraine, he conceived
a bitter aversion for the nobility, which seemed to
strengthen with time. He would never take the name &ldquo;de Méré,&rdquo;
to which he was entitled, lest he should be thought a nobleman.
At the age of fifteen he was sent to Paris to complete his education;
his father&rsquo;s teaching had already inspired him with a
passionate devotion to Greek literature, and although he showed
considerable mathematical ability, he continued to devote all his
leisure to the classics. He entered the school of artillery at
Châlons, however, and immediately on receiving his appointment
as sub-lieutenant in September 1793 he joined the army of the
Rhine. He served in various campaigns of the Revolutionary
wars, especially in those of Italy in 1798-99 and 1806-7, and in
the German campaign of 1809. He became <i>chef d&rsquo;escadron</i> in
1803.</p>

<p>He made his first appearance as an author in 1802, when he
contributed to the <i>Magasin encyclopédique</i> a critique on Johannes
Schweighäuser&rsquo;s edition of Athenaeus. In the following year
appeared his <i>Éloge d&rsquo;Hélène</i>, a free imitation rather than a
translation from Isocrates, which he had sketched in 1798.
Courier had given up his commission in the autumn of 1808, but
the general enthusiasm in Paris over the preparations for the new
campaign affected him, and he attached himself to the staff of a
general of artillery. But he was horror-struck by the carnage at
Wagram (1809), refusing from that time to believe that there was
any art in war. He hastily quitted Vienna, escaping the formal
charge of desertion because his new appointment had not been
confirmed. The savage independence of his nature rendered
subordination intolerable to him; he had been three times
disgraced for absenting himself without leave, and his superiors
resented his satirical humour. After leaving the army he went
to Florence, and was fortunate enough to discover in the
Laurentian Library a complete manuscript of Longus&rsquo;s <i>Daphnis
and Chloe</i>, an edition of which he published in 1810. In consequence
of a misadventure&mdash;blotting the manuscript&mdash;he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
involved in a quarrel with the librarian, and was compelled by
the government to leave Tuscany. He retired to his estate
at Véretz (Indre-et-Loire), but frequently visited Paris, and
divided his attention between literature and his farm.</p>

<p>After the second restoration of the Bourbons the career of
Courier as political pamphleteer began. He had before this time
waged war against local wrongs in his own district, and had been
the adviser and helpful friend of his neighbours. He now made
himself by his letters and pamphlets one of the most dreaded
opponents of the government of the Restoration. The first of
these was his <i>Pétition aux deux chambres</i> (1816), exposing the
sufferings of the peasantry under the royalist reaction. In 1817
he was a candidate for a vacant seat in the Institute; and
failing, he took his revenge by publishing a bitter <i>Lettre à Messieurs
de l&rsquo;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</i> (1819). This was
followed (1819-1820) by a series of political letters of extraordinary
power published in <i>Le Censeur Européen</i>. He advocated
a liberal monarchy, at the head of which he doubtless wished to
see Louis Philippe. The proposal, in 1821, to purchase the
estate of Chambord for the duke of Bordeaux called forth from
Courier the <i>Simple Discours de Paul Louis, vigneron de la
Chavonnière</i>, one of his best pieces. For this he was tried and
condemned to suffer a short imprisonment and to pay a fine.
Before he went to prison he published a <i>compte rendu</i> of his trial,
which had a still larger circulation than the Discours itself. In
1823 appeared the <i>Livret de Paul Louis</i>, the <i>Gazette de village</i>,
followed in 1824 by his famous <i>Pamphlet des pamphlets</i>, called
by his biographer, Armand Carrel, his swan-song. Courier published
in 1807 his translation from Xenophon, <i>Du commandement
de la cavalerie et de l&rsquo;équitation</i>, and had a share in editing
the <i>Collections des romans grecs</i>. He also projected a translation
of Herodotus, and published a specimen, in which he attempted
to imitate archaic French; but he did not live to carry out
this plan. In the autumn of 1825, on a Sunday afternoon
(August 18th), Courier was found shot in a wood near his house.
The murderers, who were servants of his own, remained undiscovered
for five years.</p>

<p>The writings of Courier, dealing with the facts and events of
his own time, are valuable sources of information as to the
condition of France before, during, and after the Revolution.
Sainte-Beuve finds in Courier&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;peu de matière et
beaucoup d&rsquo;art,&rdquo; the secret and device of his talent, which gives
his writings a value independent of the somewhat ephemeral
subject-matter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURLAND,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Kurland</span>, one of the Baltic provinces of
Russia, lying between 55° 45&prime; and 57° 45&prime; N. and 21° and 27° E.
It is bounded on the N.E. by the river Dvina, separating it from
the governments of Vitebsk and Livonia, N. by the Gulf of Riga,
W. by the Baltic, and S. by the province of East Prussia and the
Russian government of Kovno. The area is 10,535 sq. m., of
which 101 sq. m. are occupied by lakes. The surface is generally
low and undulating, and the coast-lands flat and marshy. The
interior is characterized by wooded dunes, covered with pine, fir,
birch and oak, with swamps and lakes, and fertile patches
between. The surface nowhere rises more than 700 ft. above sea-level.
The Mitau plain divides it into two parts, of which the
western is fertile and thickly inhabited, except in the north,
while the eastern is less fertile and thinly inhabited. One-third
of the area is still forest.</p>

<p>Courland is drained by nearly one hundred rivers, of which
only three, the Dvina, the Aa and the Windau, are navigable.
They all flow north-westwards and discharge into the Baltic
Sea. Owing to the numerous lakes and marshes, the climate is
damp and often foggy, as well as changeable, and the winter is
severe. Agriculture is the chief occupation, the principal crops
being rye, barley, oats, wheat, flax and potatoes. The land is
mostly owned by nobles of German descent. In 1863 laws were
issued to enable the Letts, who form the bulk of the population,
to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were
founded to help them. By this means some 12,000 farms were
bought by their occupants; but the great mass of the population
are still landless, and live as hired labourers, occupying a low
position in the social scale. On the large estates agriculture is
conducted with skill and scientific knowledge. Fruit grows well.
Excellent breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs are kept. Libau and
Mitau are the principal industrial centres, with iron-works,
agricultural machinery works, tanneries, glass and soap works.
Flax spinning is mostly a domestic industry. Iron and limestone
are the chief minerals; a little amber is found on the coast.
The only seaports are Libau, Windau and Polangen, there being
none on the Courland coast of the Gulf of Riga. The population
was 619,154 in 1870; 674,437 in 1897, of whom 345,756 were
women; 714,200 (estimate) in 1906. Of the whole, 79% are
Letts, 8¼% Germans, 1.7% Russians, and 1% each Poles and
Lithuanians. In addition there are about 8% Jews and some
Lives. The chief towns of the ten districts are Mitau (Doblenskiy
district), capital of the government (pop. 35,011 in 1897),
Bauske (6543), Friedrichstadt (5223), Goldingen (9733), Grobin
(1489), Hasenpoth (3338), Illuxt (2340), Talsen (6215), Tuckum
(7542) and Windau (7132). The prevailing religion is the
Lutheran, to which 76% of the population belong; the rest
belong to the Orthodox Eastern and the Roman Catholic
churches.</p>

<p>Anciently Courland was inhabited by the Cours or Kurs, a
Lettish tribe, who were subdued and converted to Christianity
by the Brethren of the Sword, a German military order, in the
first quarter of the 13th century. In 1237 it passed under the
rule of the Teutonic Knights owing to the amalgamation of this
order with that of the Brethren of the Sword. At that time it
comprised the two duchies of Courland and Semgallen. Under
the increasing pressure of Russia (Muscovy) the Teutonic Knights
in 1561 found it expedient to put themselves under the suzerainty
of Poland, the grandmaster Gotthard Kettler (d. 1587) becoming
the first duke of Courland. The duchy suffered severely in the
Russo-Swedish wars of 1700-9. But by the marriage in 1710
of Kettler&rsquo;s descendant, Duke Frederick William (d. 1711), to the
princess Anne, niece of Peter the Great and afterwards empress
of Russia, Courland came into close relation with the latter state
Anne being duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730. The
celebrated Marshal Saxe was elected duke in 1726, but only
managed to maintain himself by force of arms till the next year.
The last Kettler, William, titular duke of Courland, died in 1737,
and the empress Anne now bestowed the dignity on her favourite
Biren, who held it from 1737 to 1740 and again from 1763 till his
death in 1772. During nearly the whole of the 18th century
Courland, devastated by continual wars, was a shuttlecock
between Russia and Poland; until eventually in 1795 the
assembly of the nobles placed it under the Russian sceptre.
The Baltic provinces&mdash;Esthonia, Livonia and Courland&mdash;ceased
to form collectively one general government in 1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURNOT, ANTOINE AUGUSTIN<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1801-1877), French
economist and mathematician, was born at Gray (Haute-Saône)
on the 28th of August 1801. Trained for the scholastic profession,
he was appointed assistant professor at the Academy of
Paris in 1831, professor of mathematics at Lyons in 1834, rector of
the Academy of Grenoble in 1835, inspector-general of studies in
1838, rector of the Academy of Dijon and honorary inspector-general
in 1854, retiring in 1862. He died in Paris on the 31st of
March 1877. Cournot was the first who, with a competent
knowledge of both subjects, endeavoured to apply mathematics
to the treatment of economic questions. His <i>Recherches sur les
principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses</i> (English trans.
by N. T. Bacon, with bibliography of mathematics of economics
by Irving Fisher, 1897) was published in 1838. He mentions
in it only one previous enterprise of the same kind (though
there had in fact been others)&mdash;that, namely, of Nicholas
François Canard (c. 1750-1833), whose book, <i>Principes d&rsquo;économie
politique</i> (Paris, 1802), was crowned by the French Academy,
though &ldquo;its principles were radically false as well as erroneously
applied.&rdquo; Notwithstanding Cournot&rsquo;s just reputation as a
writer on mathematics, the <i>Recherches</i> made little impression.
The truth seems to be that his results are in some cases of little
importance, in others of questionable correctness, and that, in
the abstractions to which he has recourse in order to facilitate his
calculations, an essential part of the real conditions of the
problem is sometimes omitted. His pages abound in symbols
representing unknown functions, the form of the function being
left to be ascertained by observation of facts, which he does not
regard as a part of his task, or only some known properties of
the undetermined function being used as bases for deduction.
In his <i>Principes de la théorie des richesses</i> (1863) he abandoned
the mathematical method, though advocating the use of mathematical
symbols in economic discussions, as being of service in
facilitating exposition. Other works of Cournot&rsquo;s were <i>Traité
élémentaire de la théorie des fonctions et du calcul infinitésimal</i>
(1841); <i>Exposition de la théorie des chances et des probabilités</i>
(1843); <i>De l&rsquo;origine et des limites de la correspondance entre
l&rsquo;algèbre et la géométrie</i> (1847); <i>Traité de l&rsquo;enchaînement des idées
fondamentales dans les sciences et dans l&rsquo;histoire</i> (1861); and <i>Revue
sommaire des doctrines économiques</i> (1877).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURSING<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>cursus</i>, <i>currere</i>, to run), the hunting of
game by dogs solely by sight and not by scent. From time to
time the sport has been pursued by various nations against
various animals, but the recognized method has generally been
the coursing of the hare by greyhounds. Such sport is of great
antiquity, and is fully described by Arrian in his <i>Cynegeticus</i>
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 150, when the leading features appear to have been
much the same as in the present day. Other Greek and Latin
authors refer to the sport; but during the middle ages it was but
little heard of. Apart from private coursing for the sake of
filling the pot with game, public coursing has become an exhilarating
sport. The private sportsman seldom possesses good strains
of blood to breed his greyhounds from or has such opportunities
of trying them as the public courser.</p>

<p>The first known set of rules in England for determining the
merits of a course were drawn up by Thomas, duke of Norfolk, in
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign; but no open trials were heard of until
half a century later, in the time of Charles I. The oldest regular
coursing club of which any record exists is that of Swaffham, in
Norfolk, which was founded by Lord Orford in 1766; and in
1780 the Ashdown Park (Berkshire) meeting was established.
During the next seventy years many other large and influential
societies sprang up throughout England and Scotland, the
Altcar Club (on the Sefton estates, near Liverpool) being founded
in 1825. The season lasts about six months, beginning in the
middle of September. It was not until 1858 that a coursing
parliament, so to speak, was formed, and a universally accepted
code of rules drawn up. In that year the National Coursing Club
was founded. It is composed of representatives from all clubs in
the United Kingdom of more than a year&rsquo;s standing, and possessing
more than twenty-four members. Their rules govern
meetings, and their committee adjudicate on matters of dispute.
A comparative trial of two dogs, and not the capture of the game
pursued, is the great distinctive trait of modern coursing. A
greyhound stud-book was started in 1882.</p>

<p>The breeding and training of a successful kennel is a precarious
matter; and the most unaccountable ups and downs of fortune
often occur in a courser&rsquo;s career. At a meeting an agreed-on
even number of entries are made for each stake, and the ties
drawn by lot. After the first round the winner of the first tie is
opposed to the winner of the second, and so on until the last two
dogs left in compete for victory; but the same owner&rsquo;s greyhounds
are &ldquo;guarded&rdquo; as far as it is possible to do so. A staff
of beaters drive the hares out of their coverts or other hiding-places,
whilst the slipper has the pair of dogs in hand, and slips
them simultaneously by an arrangement of nooses, when they
have both sighted a hare promising a good course. The judge
accompanies on horseback, and the six points whereby he
decides a course are&mdash;(1) speed; (2) the go-by, or when a
greyhound starts a clear length behind his opponent, passes him
in the straight run, and gets a clear length in front; (3) the turn,
where the hare turns at not less than a right angle; (4) the
wrench, where the hare turns at less than a right angle; (5) the
kill; (6) the trip, or unsuccessful effort to kill. He may return a
&ldquo;no course&rdquo; as his verdict if the dogs have not been fairly tried
together, or an &ldquo;undecided course&rdquo; if he considers their merits
equal. The open Waterloo meeting, held at Altcar every spring,&mdash;the
name being taken from its being originated by the proprietor
of the Waterloo Hotel, Liverpool,&mdash;is now the recognized
fixture for the decision of the coursing championship, and the
Waterloo Cup (1836) is the &ldquo;Blue Riband&rdquo; of the leash. In the
United States, several British colonies, and other countries, the
name has been adopted, and Waterloo Coursing Cups are found
there as in England. In America an American Coursing Board
controls the sport, the chief meetings being in North and South
Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURT, ANTOINE<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1696-1760), French Protestant divine, was
born in the village of Villeneuve-de-Berg, in the province of the
Vivarais. He has been designated the &ldquo;Restorer of Protestantism
in France,&rdquo; and was the organizer of the &ldquo;Church of the Desert.&rdquo;
He was eight years old when the Camisard revolt was finally
suppressed, and nineteen when on the 8th of March 1715 the
edict of Louis XIV. was published, declaring that &ldquo;he had
abolished entirely the exercise of the so-called reformed religion&rdquo;
(&ldquo;qu&rsquo;il avait aboli tout exercice de la religion prétendue réformée&rdquo;).
Antoine, taken to the secret meetings of the persecuted Calvinists,
began, when only seventeen, to speak and exhort in these congregations
of &ldquo;the desert.&rdquo; He came to suspect after a time that
many of the so-called &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; persons were &ldquo;dupes of their
own zeal and credulity,&rdquo; and decided that it was necessary to
organize at once the small communities of believers into properly
constituted churches. To the execution of this vast undertaking
he devoted his life. On the 21st of August 1715 he summoned
all the preachers in the Cévennes and Lower Languedoc to a
conference or synod near the village of Monoblet. Here elders
were appointed, and the preaching of women, as well as pretended
revelations, was condemned. The village of Monoblet &ldquo;thus
seems entitled to the honour of having had the first organized
Protestant church after the revocation of the edict of Nantes&rdquo;
(H. M. Baird). But there were as yet no ordained pastors.
Pierre Corteiz was therefore sent to seek ordination. He was
ordained at Zürich, and from him Court himself received ordination.
The scene of his labours for fifteen years was Languedoc,
the Vivarais, and Dauphiné. His beginnings were very small
prayer-meetings in &ldquo;the desert.&rdquo; But the work progressed
under his wise direction, and he was able &ldquo;to be present, in 1744,
at meetings of ten thousand souls.&rdquo; In 1724 Louis XV., again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
assuming that there were no Protestants in France, prohibited
the most secret exercise of the Reformed religion, and imposed
severe penalties. It was impossible fully to carry out this menace.
But persecution raged, especially against the pastors. A price
was set on the life of Court; and in 1730 he escaped to Lausanne.
He had already, with the aid of some of the Protestant princes,
established a theological college (&ldquo;Seminaire de Lausanne&rdquo;)
there, and during the remaining thirty years of his life he filled
the post of director. He had the title of deputy-general of the
churches, and was really the pillar of their hope. The Seminary
of Lausanne sent forth all the pastors of the Reformed Church of
France till the days of the first French Empire. Court formed
the design of writing a history of Protestantism, and made large
collections for the purpose, which have been preserved in the
Public Library of Geneva; but this he did not live to carry out.
He died at Lausanne in 1760. He wrote, amongst other works, a
<i>Histoire des troubles des Cévennes ou de la guerre des Camisards</i>
(1760). He was the father of the more generally known Antoine
Court de Gebelin (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURT<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (from the O. Fr. <i>court</i>, Late Lat. <i>cortis</i>, <i>curtis</i>, a
popular form of class. Lat. <i>cohors</i>, gen. <i>cohortis</i>; the mod. Fr.
form <i>cour</i> is due to the influence of the Lat. <i>curia</i>, the word used
in medieval documents to translate &ldquo;court&rdquo; in the feudal sense),
a word originally denoting an enclosed place, and so surviving
in its architectural sense (courtyard, &amp;c.), but chiefly used as a
general term for judicial tribunals and in the special sense of the
household of the king, called &ldquo;the court.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1c" id="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> All law courts
were not, however, purely judicial in character; the old county
court, for instance, was the assembly of the freeholders of the
county in which representatives and certain officers were elected.
Such assemblies in early times exercised political and legislative
as well as judicial functions. But these have now been almost
entirely separated everywhere, and only judicial bodies are now
usually called courts. In every court, says Blackstone, there
must be three parts,&mdash;an <i>actor</i> or plaintiff, <i>reus</i> or defendant, and
<i>judex</i>, or judge.</p>

<p>The language of legal fictions, which English lawyers invariably
use in all constitutional subjects, makes the king the ultimate
source of all judicial authority, and assumes his personal presence
in all the courts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;As by our excellent constitution,&rdquo; says Blackstone, &ldquo;the sole
executive power of the laws is vested in the person of the king, it
will follow that all courts of justice, which are the medium by which
he administers the laws, are derived from the power of the crown.
For whether created by act of parliament or letters patent, or
subsisting by prescription (the only methods by which any court of
judicature can exist), the king&rsquo;s consent in the two former is expressly,
in the latter impliedly given. In all these courts the king is
supposed in contemplation of law to be always present; but as that
is in fact impossible, he is then represented by his judges, whose
power is only an emanation of the royal prerogative.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>These words might give a false impression of the historical and
legal relations of the courts and the crown, if it is not remembered
that they are nothing more than the expression of a venerable
fiction. The administration of justice was, indeed, one of the
functions of the king in early times; the king himself sat on
circuit so late as the reign of Edward IV.; and even after regular
tribunals were established, a reserve of judicial power still
remained in the king and his council, in the exercise of which it
was possible for the king to participate personally. The last
judicial act of an English king, if such it can be called, was that
by which James I. settled the dispute between the court of
chancery and courts of common law. Since the establishment
of parliamentary government the courts take their law directly
from the legislature, and the king is only connected with them
indirectly as a member of the legislative body. The king&rsquo;s name,
however, is still used in this as in other departments of state
action. The courts exercising jurisdiction in England are divided
by certain features which may here be briefly indicated.</p>

<p>We may distinguish between (1) superior and inferior courts.
The former are the courts of common law and the court of
chancery, now High Court of Justice. The latter are the local or
district courts, county courts, &amp;c. (2) Courts of record and courts
not of record. &ldquo;A court of record is one whereof the acts and
judicial proceedings are enrolled for a perpetual memory and
testimony, which rolls are called the records of the court, and are
of such high and supereminent authority that their truth is not
to be called in question. For it is a settled rule and maxim that
nothing shall be averred against a record, nor shall any plea or
even proof be admitted to the contrary. And if the existence of
the record shall be denied it shall be tried by nothing but itself;
that is, upon bare inspection whether there be any such record or
no; else there would be no end of disputes. All courts of record
are the courts of the sovereign in right of the crown and royal
dignity, and therefore any court of record has authority to fine
and imprison for contempt of its authority&rdquo; (Stephen&rsquo;s <i>Blackstone</i>).
(3) Courts may also be distinguished as civil or criminal.
(4) A further distinction is to be made between courts of first
instance and courts of appeal. In the former the first hearing in
any judicial proceeding takes place; in the latter the judgment
of the first court is brought under review. Of the superior
courts, the High Court of Justice in its various divisions is a court
of first instance. Over it is the court of appeal, and over that
again the House of Lords. The High Court of Justice is (through
divisional courts) a court of appeal for inferior courts. (5) There
is a special class of local courts, which do not appear to fall
within the description of either superior or inferior courts.
Some, while administering the ordinary municipal law, have or
had jurisdiction exclusive of their superior courts; such were the
common pleas of Durham and Lancaster. Others have concurrent
jurisdiction with the superior courts; such are the lord mayor&rsquo;s
court of London, the passage court of Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The distribution of judicial business among the various courts
of law in England may be exhibited as follows.</p>

<p><i>Criminal Courts.</i>&mdash;(1) The lowest is that of the justice of the
peace, sitting in petty sessions of two or more, to determine in a
summary way certain specified minor offences. In populous
districts, such as London, Manchester, &amp;c., stipendiary magistrates
are appointed, generally with enlarged powers. Besides
punishing by summary conviction, justices may commit prisoners
for trial at the assizes. (2) The justices in quarter sessions are
commissioned to determine felonies and other offences. An act
of 1842 (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 38) contains a list of offences <i>not</i> triable
at quarter sessions&mdash;treason, murder, forgery, bigamy, &amp;c. (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quarter Sessions, Court of</a></span>). The corresponding court in
a borough is presided over by a recorder. (3) The more serious
offences are reserved for the judges of the superior courts sitting
under a commission of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery for each
county. The assize courts, as they are called, sit in general in
each county twice a year, following the division of circuits; but
additional assizes are also held under acts of 1876 and 1877,
which permit several counties to be united together for that
purpose (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Circuit</a></span>). London, which occupies an exceptional
position in all matters of judicature, has a high criminal court of
its own, established by the Central Criminal Court Act 1834,
under the name of the central criminal court. Its judges usually
present are a rota selected from the superior judges of common
law, the recorder, common serjeant, and the judge of the City of
London court.<a name="FnAnchor_2c" id="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The criminal appeal court, to which all persons
convicted on indictment may appeal, superseded in 1908 (by the
Criminal Appeal Act 1907) the court for crown cases reserved,
to which any question of law arising on the trial of a prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
could after conviction be remitted by the judge in his discretion.
To the criminal appeal court there is an appeal both on questions
of fact and of law (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Appeal</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Civil Courts.</i>&mdash;In certain special cases, civil claims of small
importance may be brought before justices or stipendiaries.
Otherwise, and excepting the special and peculiar jurisdictions
above mentioned, the civil business of England and Wales may be
said to be divided between the county courts (taking small cases)
and the High Court of Justice (taking all others).</p>

<p>The effect of the Judicature Acts on the constitution of the
superior courts may be briefly stated. There is now one Supreme
Court of Judicature, consisting of two permanent divisions
called the High Court of Justice and the court of appeal. The
former takes the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, the three
common law courts, the courts of admiralty, probate, and divorce,
the courts of pleas at Lancaster and Durham, and the courts
created by commissions of assize, oyer and terminer, and gaol
delivery. The latter takes the jurisdiction of the court of appeal
in chancery (including chancery of Lancaster), the court of the
lord warden of the stannaries, and of the exchequer chamber, and
the appellate jurisdiction in admiralty and heresy matters of the
judicial committee; and power is given to the sovereign to
transfer the remaining jurisdiction of that court to the court of
appeal. By the Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1876 the House of
Lords is enabled to sit for the hearing of appeals from the
English court of appeal and the Scottish and Irish courts during
the prorogation and dissolution of parliament. The lords of
appeal, of whom three must be present, are the lord chancellor,
the lords of appeal in ordinary, and peers who have held &ldquo;high
judicial office&rdquo; in Great Britain or Ireland. The lords in
ordinary are an innovation in the constitution of the House.
They hold the rank of baron for life only, have a right to sit and
vote in the House during tenure of office only, and a salary of
£6000 per annum.</p>

<p>There are also many obsolete or decayed courts, of which the
most noticeable are dealt with under their individual headings, as
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Court Baron</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Court Leet</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The history of English courts affords a remarkable illustration
of the continuity that characterizes English institutions. It
might perhaps be too much to say that all the courts now sitting
in England may be traced back to a common origin, but at any
rate the higher courts are all offshoots from the same original
judicature. Leaving out of account the local courts, we find the
higher jurisdiction after the Norman Conquest concentrated
along with all other public functions in the king and council.
The first sign of a separation of the judicial from the other
powers of this body is found in the recognition of a Curia Regis,
which may be described as the king&rsquo;s council, or a portion of it,
charged specially with the management of judicial and revenue
business. In relation to the revenue it became the exchequer,
under which name a separate court grew up whose special field
was the judicial business arising out of revenue cases. By Magna
Carta the inconvenience caused by the curia following the king&rsquo;s
person was remedied, in so far as private litigation was concerned,
by the order that common pleas (Communia Placita) should be
held at some fixed place; and hence arose the court of common
pleas. The Curia Regis, after having thrown off these branches,
is represented by the king&rsquo;s bench, so that from the same stock
we have now three courts, differing at first in functions, but
through competition for business, and the ingenious use of
fictions, becoming finally the co-ordinate courts of common law
of later history. But an inner circle of counsellors still surrounded
the king, and in his name claimed to exercise judicial as well as
other power; hence the chancellor&rsquo;s jurisdiction, which became,
partly in harmony with the supra-legal power claimed from which
it sprang, and partly through the influence of the ecclesiastical
chancellors by whom it was first administered, the equity of
English law. Similar developments of the same authority were
the court of requests (which was destroyed by a decision of the
common pleas) and the court of star chamber&mdash;a court of
criminal equity, as it has been called,&mdash;which, having been made
the instrument of tyranny, was abolished in 1641. Even then
the productive power of the council was not exhausted; the
judicial committee of the privy council, established in 1832,
superseding the previous court of delegates, exercises the jurisdiction
in appeal belonging to the king in council. The appellate
jurisdiction of the Lords rests on their claim to be the representatives
of the ancient great council of the realm.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The Federal judicial system of the United
States is made by the Constitution independent both of the
Legislature and of the Executive. It consists of the Supreme
Court, the circuit courts, and the district courts.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is created by the Constitution, and
consisted in 1909 of nine judges, who are nominated by the
President and confirmed by the Senate. They hold office during
good behaviour, <i>i.e.</i> are removable only by impeachment, thus
having a tenure even more secure than that of English judges.
The court sits at Washington from October to July in every year.
The sessions of the court are held in the Capitol. A rule requiring
the presence of six judges to pronounce a decision prevents the
division of the court into two or more benches; and while this
secures a thorough consideration of every case, it also retards the
despatch of business. Every case is discussed twice by the whole
body, once to ascertain the view of the majority, which is then
directed to be set forth in a written opinion; then again, when
the written opinion, prepared by one of the judges, is submitted
for criticism and adoption by the court as its judgment.</p>

<p>The other Federal courts have been created by Congress under
a power in the Constitution to establish &ldquo;inferior courts.&rdquo; The
circuit courts consist of twenty-nine circuit judges, acting in nine
judicial circuits, while to each circuit there is also allotted one of
the justices of the Supreme Court. Circuit courts of appeals,
established to relieve the Supreme Court, consist of three judges
(two forming a quorum), and are made up of the circuit and
district judges of each circuit and the Supreme Court justice
assigned to the circuit. Some cases may, however, be appealed
to the Supreme Court from the circuit court of appeals, and
others directly from the lower courts. The district courts
number (1909) ninety, in most cases having a single justice.
There is also a special tribunal called the court of claims, which
deals with the claims of private persons against the Federal
government. It is not strictly a part of the general judicial
system, but is a creation of Congress designed to relieve that body
of a part of its own labours.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Federal courts extends only to those
cases in which the Constitution makes Federal law applicable.
All other cases are left to the state courts, from which there is no
appeal to the Federal courts, unless where some specific point
arises which is affected by the Federal Constitution or a Federal
law. The classes of cases dealt with by the Federal courts are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution,
the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their
authority;</p>

<p>2. Cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
consuls;</p>

<p>3. Cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;</p>

<p>4. Controversies to which the United States shall be a party;</p>

<p>5. Controversies between two or more states, between a state
and citizens of another state, between citizens of different states,
between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of
different states, and between a state or the citizens thereof and
foreign states, citizens or subjects (<i>Const.</i>, Art. III., § 2). Part
of this jurisdiction has, however, been withdrawn by the eleventh
Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that &ldquo;the
judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
extend to any suit commenced or prosecuted against one of the
United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or
subjects of any foreign state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original in cases
affecting ambassadors, and wherever a state is a party; in other
cases it is appellate. In some matters the jurisdiction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
Federal courts is exclusive; in others it is concurrent with that of
the state courts.</p>

<p>As it frequently happens that cases come before state courts in
which questions of Federal law arise, a provision has been made
whereby due respect for the latter is secured by giving the party
to a suit who relies upon Federal law, and whose contention is
overruled by a state court, the right of having the suit removed
to a Federal court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 (as amended by
subsequent legislation) provides for the removal to the Supreme
Court of the United States of &ldquo;a final judgment or decree in any
suit rendered in the highest court of a state in which a decision
could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty
or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States,
and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in
question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised
under, any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the
Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the
decision is in favour of their validity; or where any title, right,
privilege or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any
treaty or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised
under the United States, and the decision is against the title,
right, privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed by either
party under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission or
authority.&rdquo; If the decision of the state court is in favour of the
right claimed under Federal law or against the validity or applicability
of the state law set up, there is no ground for removal,
because the applicability or authority of Federal law in the
particular case could receive no further protection from a Federal
court than has in fact been given by the state court.</p>

<p>The power exercised by the Supreme Court in declaring
statutes of Congress or of state legislatures (or acts of the
Executive) to be invalid because inconsistent with the Federal
Constitution, has been deemed by many Europeans a peculiar
and striking feature of the American system. There is, however,
nothing novel or mysterious about it. As the Federal Constitution,
which emanates directly from the people, is the supreme law
of the land everywhere, any statute passed by any lower
authority (whether the Federal Congress or a state legislature),
which contravenes the Constitution, must necessarily be invalid
in point of law, just as in the United Kingdom a railway by-law
which contravened an act of parliament would be invalid. Now,
the functions of judicial tribunals&mdash;of all courts alike, whether
Federal or state, whether superior or inferior&mdash;is to interpret the
law, and if any tribunal finds a Congressional statute or state
statute inconsistent with the Constitution, the tribunal is
obliged to hold such statute invalid. A tribunal does this not
because it has any right or power of its own in the matter, but
because the people have, in enacting the Constitution as a supreme
law, declared that all other laws inconsistent with it are <i>ipso jure</i>
void. When a tribunal has ascertained that an inferior law is
thus inconsistent, that inferior law is therewith, so far as
inconsistent, to be deemed void. The tribunal does not enter
any conflict with the Legislature or Executive. All it does
is to declare that a conflict exists between two laws of different
degrees of authority, whence it necessarily follows that the
weaker law is extinct. This duty of interpretation belongs to all
tribunals, but as constitutional cases are, if originating in a lower
court, usually carried by appeal to the Supreme Court, men have
grown accustomed to talk of the Supreme Court as in a special
sense the guardian of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Federal courts never deliver an opinion on any constitutional
question unless or until that question is brought before
them in the form of a lawsuit. A judgment of the Supreme
Court is only a judgment on the particular case before it, and
does not prevent a similar question being raised again in another
lawsuit, though of course this seldom happens, because it may
be assumed that the court will adhere to its former opinion.
There have, however, been instances in which the court has
virtually changed its view on a constitutional question, and it is
understood to be entitled so to do.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURT BARON,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> an English manorial court dating from the
middle ages and still in existence. It was laid down by Coke
that a manor had two courts, &ldquo;the first by the common law, and
is called a court baron,&rdquo; the freeholders (&ldquo;barons&rdquo;) being its
suitors; the other a customary court for the copyholders.
Stubbs adopted this explanation, but the latest learning, expounded
by Professor Maitland, holds that court baron means
<i>curia baronis</i>, &ldquo;<i>la court de seigneur</i>,&rdquo; and that there is no evidence
for there being more than one court. The old view that at least
two freeholders were required for its composition is also now
discarded. Prof. Maitland&rsquo;s conclusion is that the &ldquo;court baron&rdquo;
was not even differentiated from the &ldquo;court-leet&rdquo; at the close
of the 13th century, but that there was a distinction of jurisdictional
rights, some courts having only feudal rights, while
others had regalities as well. When the court-leet was differentiated,
the court baron remained with feudal rights alone.
These rights he was disposed to trace to a lord&rsquo;s jurisdiction over
his men rather than to his possession of the manor, although in
practice, from an early date, the court was associated with the
manor. Its chief business was to administer the &ldquo;custom of the
manor&rdquo; and to admit fresh tenants who had acquired copyholds
by inheritance or purchase, and had to pay, on so doing, a &ldquo;fine&rdquo;
to the lord of the manor. It is mainly for the latter purpose that
the court is now kept. It is normally presided over by the
steward of the lord of the manor, who is a lawyer, and its proceedings
are recorded on &ldquo;the court rolls,&rdquo; of which the older
ones are now valuable for genealogical as well as for legal purposes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURT DE GEBELIN, ANTOINE<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (1728-1784), French scholar,
son of Antoine Court (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Nîmes in 1728. He
received a good education, and became, like his father, a pastor
of the Reformed Church. This office, however, he soon relinquished,
to devote himself entirely to literary work. He had
conceived the project of a work which should set in a new light
the phenomena, especially the languages and mythologies, of the
ancient world; and, after his father&rsquo;s death, he went to Paris in
order to be near the necessary books. After long years of research,
he published in 1775 the first volume of his vast undertaking
under the title of <i>Le Monde primitif, analysé et comparé avec le
monde moderne</i>. The ninth volume appeared in 1784, leaving the
work still unfinished. The literary world marvelled at the encyclopaedic
learning displayed by the author, and supposed that the
French Academy, or some other society of scholars, must have
combined their powers in its production. Now, however, the
world has well-nigh forgotten the huge quartos. These learned
labours did not prevent Gebelin from pleading earnestly the cause
of religious tolerance. In 1760 he published a work entitled
<i>Les Toulousaines</i>, advocating the rights of the Protestants; and
he afterwards established at Paris an agency for collecting
information as to their sufferings, and for exciting general
interest in their cause. He co-operated with Franklin and
others in the periodical work entitled <i>Affaires de l&rsquo;Angleterre et
de l&rsquo;Amérique</i> (1776, sqq.), which was devoted to the support
of American independence. He was also a supporter of the
principles of the economists, and Quesnay called him his well-beloved
disciple. In the last year of his life he became acquainted
with Mesmer, and published a <i>Lettre sur le magnétisme animal</i>.
He was imposed upon by speculators in whom he placed
confidence, and was reduced to destitution by the failure of a
scheme in which they engaged him. He died at Paris on the
10th of May 1784.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTENAY,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> the name of a famous English family. French
genealogists head the pedigree of this family with one Athon or
Athos, who is said to have fortified Courtenay in Gâtinois about
the year 1010. His son Josselin had, with other issue, Miles,
lord of Courtenay, founder of the Cistercian abbey of Fontaine-Jean.
By his wife Ermengarde, daughter of Renaud, count of
Nevers, Miles left a son Renaud, one of the magnates who
followed Louis le Jeune to the Holy Land. This was the last lord
of Courtenay of the line of Athon. Elizabeth, his elder daughter&mdash;a
younger daughter died without issue,&mdash;carried Courtenay and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
other lordships to her husband Pierre, seventh and youngest son
of the French king Louis VI. the Fat, the marriage taking place
about 1150, and the many descendants of this royal match bore
the surname of Courtenay.</p>

<p>Pierre, the eldest son, was founder of a short-lived dynasty of
emperors of Constantinople, which ended in 1261 when Baldwin
(Baudouin), last of the Frankish emperors, fled before Michael
Palaeologus from a capital in flames. Baldwin&rsquo;s son Philip,
however, bore the empty title, and his granddaughter Catherine,
wife of Charles, count of Valois, was titular empress. Other
lines of the royal Courtenays, sprung from Pierre of France,
were lords of Champignolles, Tanlai, Yerre, Bleneau, La Ferté
Loupière and Chevillon. On the death of Gaspard, sieur de
Bleneau, in 1655, his cousin Louis de Courtenay, comte de Cési
(<i>jure uxoris</i>) and sieur de Chevillon, had Bleneau, and reckoned
himself the surviving chief of his house. He styled himself Prince
de Courtenay and his family made attempts to obtain recognition
for their royal blood. But their laboriously constructed genealogies
availed nothing to this impoverished race. The last
&ldquo;Prince de Courtenay,&rdquo; an ex-captain of dragoons, died in 1730;
his uncle Roger de Courtenay, abbé des Eschalis, who died in
1733, was the last recognized member of the line of Pierre of
France.</p>

<p>A younger branch of the first house of Courtenay came from
Josselin, second son of Josselin, son of Athon. This Josselin, a
notable crusader, went to the Holy Land with the count of Blois,
and held by the sword for eleven years the county of Edessa,
given him by his cousin King Baldwin II. Edessa was won back
by the infidel from his son Josselin, who died a prisoner in Aleppo
in 1147. A grandson, also a Josselin, was seneschal of the kingdom
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In England a house of Courtenay has flourished with varying
fortunes since the reign of the first Angevin king. The monks of
Ford, to whom they were benefactors, complacently set down
their patrons as the offspring of the royal Courtenays, of whose
origin they had some dim knowledge, deriving them from
&ldquo;Florus,&rdquo; son of Louis the Fat. A comparison of dates destroys
the story. But they were, doubtless, Courtenays of the stock of
Athon. Josselin, the first count of Edessa, has been suggested by
modern writers as their founder, but the name Reinaud, borne by
the first known ancestor of the English house, suggests that they
may have sprung from a younger son of Josselin I. of Courtenay
by his marriage about 1095 with Ermengarde, daughter of
Reinaud, count of Nevers. It is also notable that the English
Courtenays have, from the first introduction of armorial bearings,
borne with various differences the three red roundels in a golden
field, the arms of the Courtenays in France, the shield of the earls
of Devonshire being identical with that of the lords of La Ferté
Loupière.</p>

<p>Several Courtenays whose kinship cannot be exactly ascertained,
appear in English records of the 12th century. One
of them, Robert de Courtenay, married the daughter and
heir of Reynold fitz Urse, the leader of the murderers of Archbishop
Thomas Becket. His son, William, a Shropshire baron,
held the castle of Montgomery, as heir by his mother of Baldwin
de Buslers, or Bollers, to whom Henry I. had given it with his
&ldquo;niece&rdquo; Sibil de Falaise. This William married Ada of Dunbar,
daughter of Patrick, earl of Dunbar, but died in the reign of King
John, without issue.</p>

<p>Reinaud de Courtenay, ancestor of the main English line, may
well have been a brother of the Robert above named. The
English pedigrees confuse him with his son of the same name.
He was a favourite with Henry II., his attestations of charters
showing him as a constant companion at home and abroad of the
king, whom he followed to Wexford in the Irish expedition of
1172. Henry gave him Berkshire lands at Sutton, still known as
Sutton Courtenay, by a charter to which the date of 1161 can be
assigned. In England he had to wife Maude, daughter of Robert
fitz Roy by Maude of Avranches, the elder Maude being the heir
of the house of Brionne. By her, who survived him, dying
before January 1224, he had no issue, but by a wife who may
have died before his coming to England he had, with other issue,
Robert and Reinaud. Robert, who succeeded to Sutton about
1192, was husband of Alice de Rumeli, widow of Gilbert Pipard,
and one of the three sisters and co-heirs of William, the boy of
Egremond, of whose drowning in the Strid Wordsworth has
made a ballad. Robert died childless in 1209. Of his brother
Reinaud or Reynold de Courtenay little is known, save that he
was a married man in 1178 when he and his wife Hawise were
given by the pope a licence to have a free chapel at Okehampton.
This wife, Hawise de Ayencourt, was, with Maude his father&rsquo;s
second wife, a daughter and co-heir of Maude of Avranches, her
father being the lord of Ayencourt, first husband of the last
named Maude. Her great inheritance included the honour of
Okehampton in Devonshire of which, as a widow, she had livery
about 1205. Her son, Robert de Courtenay, succeeded to her
land in 1219, having been his uncle Robert&rsquo;s heir in Sutton ten
years before. Like his father he advanced his house by a great
marriage, his wife being Mary, the younger daughter of William
de Vernon, earl of Devon and of the Isle of Wight. He was
succeeded in 1242 by his son John, who by Isabel, a daughter of
Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford, has issue Hugh, whose wife was
Eleanor, daughter of the earl of Winchester, elder of the two
favourites of Edward II. The son of this marriage, another
Hugh, followed his father at Okehampton in 1291. Two years
later died Isabel, surviving sister and heir of Baldwin de Reviers,
earl of Devon, and widow of William de Forz, last earl of
Aumerle (Albemarle). On her death-bed she had granted her
lordship of the Wight to the king, but her cousin Hugh de
Courtenay succeeded her in the unalienated estates of the house of
Reviers. He was summoned as a baron on the 6th of February
1298/9, and in 1300 he displayed his banner before the castle
of Caerlaverock. Claiming the &ldquo;third penny&rdquo; of the county of
Devon, he was refused by the exchequer as he did not claim in the
name of an earl. Following, however, a writ of inquiry, a patent
of the 22nd of February 1334/5 declared him earl of Devon
and qualified to take such style as his ancestors, earls of Devon,
were wont to take. Hugh, his son, the second earl, a warrior who
drove the French back from their descent on Cornwall in 1339,
made another of the brilliant marriages of this family, his wife
being Eleanor, daughter of Humfrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford
and Essex, by Elizabeth daughter of Edward I. Their eldest
son, Sir Hugh de Courtenay, shared in the honours of Crécy and
Calais, and was one of the knights founders of the order of the
Garter, the stall-plate of his arms being yet in St George&rsquo;s
chapel at Windsor. This knight died in the lifetime of the earl,
as did his only son Hugh, summoned as a baron on the 3rd of
January 1370/1, a companion at Najara of the Black Prince,
whose step-daughter Maude of Holland he had married. The
earl was therefore succeeded by his grandson Edward (son of
Edward his third son), earl marshal of England in 1385, who died
blind in 1419, the year after the death of Sir Edward his heir
apparent, one of the conquerors at Agincourt. Hugh, a second
son of Earl Edward, succeeded as fourth earl of the Courtenay
line. By his wife, a sister of the renowned Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury,
he had issue Thomas the fifth earl, a partisan of Henry VI.,
whose wife was Margaret Beaufort, daughter of John, earl of
Somerset. The effigy of this grandaughter of John of Gaunt,
with the shields of Courtenay and Beaufort above it, is in Colyton
church. It is less than life size, a fact which has given rise to a
village legend that it represents &ldquo;Little choke-a-bone,&rdquo; an infant
daughter of the tenth earl, who died &ldquo;choked by a fish bone.&rdquo;
In spite of the evidence of the shields and the 15th century dress
of the effigy, the legend has now been strengthened by an
inscription upon a brass plate, and in the year 1907 ignorance
engaged a monumental sculptor to deface the effigy by giving its
broken features the newly carved face of a young child. Both
sons of this marriage fell in the Wars of the Roses, Thomas the
sixth earl being taken at Towton by the Yorkists and beheaded
at York in 1462, his younger brother Henry having the same fate
at Salisbury in 1466.</p>

<p>The earldom being extinguished by attainder, Sir Humphrey
Stafford was created earl of Devon in 1469, but in the same
year, having retired with his men from the expedition against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
Robin of Redesdale, another earl of Devon suffered at the
headsman&rsquo;s hands, his patent being afterwards annulled by a
statute of Henry VII. On the restoration of Henry VI. John
Courtenay, only surviving brother of Thomas and Henry, was
restored to the earldom by the reversal of attainder. He, too,
died in the Lancastrian cause, being killed on the 4th of May 1471
at Tewkesbury, where he led the rear of the host. The representation
of the Reviers earls and of the Courtenay barony fell then to
his sisters and their descendants. Beside him at Tewkesbury
died his cousin Sir Hugh Courtenay of Boconnoc, son of Hugh,
a younger brother of the blind earl, leaving a son Edward, who
thus became the heir male of the house though not its heir
general. Joining in the cause which had cost so many of his
kinsmen their lives, he and his brother Walter shared the duke of
Buckingham&rsquo;s rising. On its failure they fled into France to the
earl of Richmond, beside whom Sir Edward fought at Bosworth.
By a patent of the 26th of October 1485 he was created earl of
Devon with remainder to the heirs male of his body, and by an
act of 1485 he was restored to all honours lost in his attainder by
the Yorkist parliament. He defended Exeter against Warbeck&rsquo;s
rebels and was a knight of the Garter in 1489, dying twenty years
later, when the earldom became again forfeit by his son&rsquo;s attainder.
That son, William Courtenay, had drawn the jealousy of Henry
VII. by a marriage with Catherine, sister of the queen and
daughter of King Edward IV., the Yorkist sovereign whose hand
had been so heavy on the Courtenays. After the queen&rsquo;s death,
Henry sent his wife&rsquo;s brother-in-law to the Tower on a charge of
corresponding with Edmund Pole, an attainder following. But
on the accession of Henry VIII., the young king released his
uncle, who although styled an earl was not fully restored in blood
at his death in 1511. His son Henry Courtenay obtained from
parliament in December 1512 a reversal of his father&rsquo;s attainder,
thus succeeding to the earldom of his grandfather. At the Field
of Cloth of Gold he ran a course with the king of France. He
was knight of the Garter and on the 15th of June 1525 had a
patent as marquess of Exeter. Profiting by the suppression of
the monasteries he increased his estate, his power being all but
supreme in the west country. But Cromwell was his enemy and
the royal strain in his blood was a dangerous thing. Involved in
correspondence with Cardinal Pole, he was sent to the Tower with
his wife and his young son, and on the 9th of December 1538 he
was beheaded as a traitor. The misfortunes of the house were
heavy upon the son, who at twelve years old was a prisoner for
the sake of his high descent. His honours had been forfeited,
and release did not come until the accession of Queen Mary, who
took him into favour. Noailles the ambassador found him <i>le
plus beau et le plus agréable gentilhomme d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>, and he had
some hopes of becoming king consort. The queen created him
earl of Devonshire by a patent of the 3rd of September 1553 and
in the next month he was restored in blood. But, disappointed in
his hopes, he formed some wild plans for marrying the Lady
Elizabeth and making her queen. He could raise Devon and
Cornwall. Wyat did raise Kent, but the plot was soon crushed.
The earl was sent back to the Tower and thence to Fotheringhay.
At Easter of 1555 he was released on parole and exiled, dying
suddenly at Padua in 1556. His co-heirs were the descendants of
the four sisters of Earl Edward (d. 1519), the wives of four
Cornish squires, and with him was extinguished, to the belief of
all men, the Courtenays&rsquo; earldom of Devon. His heir male was
Sir William Courtenay, his sixth cousin once removed, head of a
knightly line of Courtenays whose seat was Powderham Castle,
a line which, during the civil wars, stood for the White Rose.
Sir William, who is said to have been killed at St Quintin in 1557,
was succeeded by his son, another Sir William, one of the undertakers
for the settling of Ireland, where the family obtained great
estates. William Courtenay of Powderham, of whose marriage
with the daughter of Sir William Waller (the parliament&rsquo;s
general) it is remarked that the years of bride and bridegroom
added together were less than thirty when their first child was
born, was created a baronet by writ of privy seal in February
1644, the patent being never enrolled. His great grandson, Sir
William Courtenay, many years a member of parliament, was on
the 6th of May 1762, ten days before his death, created Viscount
Courtenay of Powderham Castle.</p>

<p>Since the death at Padua in 1556 of Edward, earl of Devon,
that ancient title had been twice revived. Charles Blount,
Lord Mountjoy, who was created earl of Devon in 1603, died
without lawful issue in 1606. In 1618 Sir William Cavendish,
son of the famous Bess of Hardwick, was given the same title,
which is still among the peerage honours of the ducal house
descending from him. For the Courtenays, who had without
protest accepted a baronetcy and a viscounty, their earldom was
dead. In the reign of William IV., the third and last Viscount
Courtenay was living unmarried in Paris, an exile who for
sufficient reasons was keeping out of the reach of the English
criminal law. In the name of this man, his presumptive heir
male, William Courtenay, clerk assistant of the parliament,
succeeded in persuading the House of Lords that the Courtenay
earldom under the patent of 1553 was still in existence, the plea
being that the terms of the remainder&mdash;to him and his heirs male
for ever&mdash;did not limit the succession to heirs male of the body
of the grantee. Five other cases wherein the words <i>de corpore suo</i>
had been omitted from the patent are known to peerage lawyers.
In no case had a peerage before been claimed by collateral
heirs male. &ldquo;I have often rallied Brougham,&rdquo; writes Lord
Campbell, &ldquo;upon his creating William Courtenay earl of Devon.
He says he consulted Chief Justice Tenterden. But Tenterden
knew nothing of peerage law.&rdquo; After the death of the exile in
1835 the clerk of the parliament succeeded him as an earl by
force of the House of Lords decision of the 15th of March 1831.
His second son, the Rev. Henry Hugh Courtenay (1811-1904),
succeeded, as 13th earl, a nephew whose extravagance had impoverished
the estates. He in turn was followed, as 14th earl, by
his grandson Charles Pepys Courtenay (b. 1870).</p>

<p>No other recognized branch of this house, once so widely
spread in the western counties, is now among the landed houses of
England. Among its cadets were many famous warriors, but
three prelates must be reckoned as the most eminent of the
Courtenays. William, a younger son of the match of Courtenay
and Bohun, was bishop of Hereford in 1370, bishop of London in
1375 and archbishop of Canterbury in 1381. Proceeding against
Wycliffe he opposed John of Gaunt, who, taunting him with his
trust in his great kinsfolk, threatened to drag him out of St Paul&rsquo;s
by his hair, a threat which roused the angry Londoners in his
defence. He died in 1396 and lies buried at the feet of the Black
Prince in his cathedral of Canterbury. By his will he left his best
mitre to his nephew Richard Courtenay&mdash;son and pupil, as he
styles him&mdash;against the time he should be a bishop. This Richard,
a friend of Henry V. when prince, and treasurer of his household,
was bishop of Norwich in 1413. Twice chancellor of Oxford, he
repelled Archbishop Arundel and all his train when that primate
would have had a visitation of the university, although the
claim of the university to independence was at last broken down.
Tall of stature, eloquent and learned, he kept the favour of the
king, who was with him when he died of dysentery in the host
before Harfleur. Heir of this bishop was his nephew Sir Philip
of Powderham, whose younger son Peter Courtenay was the
third of the Courtenay prelates, being bishop of Exeter from 1478
to 1487, when he was translated to Winchester. Although of the
Yorkist Courtenays, he was of Buckingham&rsquo;s party and, being
attainted by Richard III. for joining with certain of his kinsfolk in
an attempt to raise the west, he escaped to Brittany, whence he
returned with the first Tudor sovereign, who had him in high
favour. A fourth prelate of this family was Henry Reginald
Courtenay, who was bishop of Bristol 1794-1797 and bishop of
Exeter from 1797 to his death in 1803.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTENAY, RICHARD<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (d. 1415), English prelate, was a son
of Sir Philip Courtenay of Powderham Castle, near Exeter, and
a grandson of Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon (d. 1377). He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
was a nephew of William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury,
and a descendant of Edward I. Educated at Exeter College,
Oxford, he entered the church, where his advance was rapid.
He held several prebends, was dean of St Asaph and then dean of
Wells, and became bishop of Norwich in 1413. As chancellor of
the university of Oxford, an office to which he was elected in 1407
and again in 1410, Courtenay asserted the independence of the
university against Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, in
1411; but the archbishop, supported by Henry IV. and Pope
John XXIII, eventually triumphed. Courtenay was a personal
friend of Henry V. both before and after he came to the throne;
and in 1413, immediately after Henry&rsquo;s accession, he was made
treasurer of the royal household. On two occasions he went on
diplomatic errands to France, and he was also employed by
Henry on public business at home. Having accompanied the
king to Harfleur in August 1415, Courtenay was attacked by
dysentery and died on the 15th of September 1415, his body
being buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Another member of this family, <span class="sc">Peter Courtenay</span> (d. 1492),
a grandnephew of Richard, also attained high position in the
English Church. Educated at Exeter College, Oxford, Peter
became dean of Windsor, then dean of Exeter; in 1478 bishop
of Exeter; and in 1487 bishop of Winchester in succession to
William of Waynflete. With Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham,
and others he attempted to raise a rebellion against Richard
III. in 1483, and fled to Brittany when this enterprise failed.
Courtenay was restored to his dignities and estates in 1485 by
Henry VII., whom he had accompanied to England, and he died
on the 23rd of September 1492.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTENAY, WILLIAM<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (c. 1342-1396), English prelate, was
a younger son of Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon (d. 1377), and
through his mother Margaret, daughter of Humphrey Bohun,
earl of Hereford, was a great-grandson of Edward I. Being a
native of the west of England he was educated at Stapledon Hall,
Oxford, and after graduating in law was chosen chancellor of
the university in 1367. Courtenay&rsquo;s ecclesiastical and political
career began about the same time. Having been made prebendary
of Exeter, of Wells and of York, he was consecrated bishop of
Hereford in 1370, was translated to the see of London in 1375,
and became archbishop of Canterbury in 1381, succeeding Simon
of Sudbury in both these latter positions. As a politician the
period of his activity coincides with the years of Edward III.&rsquo;s
dotage, and with practically the whole of Richard II.&rsquo;s reign.
From the first he ranged himself among the opponents of John
of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster; he was a firm upholder of the
rights of the English Church, and was always eager to root out
Lollardry. In 1373 he declared in convocation that he would not
contribute to a subsidy until the evils from which the church
suffered were removed; in 1375 he incurred the displeasure of the
king by publishing a papal bull against the Florentines; and in
1377 his decided action during the quarrel between John of
Gaunt and William of Wykeham ended in a temporary triumph
for the bishop. Wycliffe was another cause of difference between
Lancaster and Courtenay. In 1377 the reformer appeared
before Archbishop Sudbury and Courtenay, when an altercation
between the duke and the bishop led to the dispersal of the court,
and during the ensuing riot Lancaster probably owed his safety
to the good offices of his foe. Having meanwhile become archbishop
of Canterbury Courtenay summoned a council, or synod,
in London, which condemned the opinions of Wycliffe; he then
attacked the Lollards at Oxford, and urged the bishops to
imprison heretics. He was for a short time chancellor of England
during 1381, and in January 1382 he officiated at the marriage of
Richard II. with Anne of Bohemia, afterwards crowning the
queen. In 1382 the archbishop&rsquo;s visitation led to disputes with
the bishops of Exeter and Salisbury, and Courtenay was only
partially able to enforce the payment of a special tax to meet his
expenses on this occasion. During his concluding years the
archbishop appears to have upheld the papal authority in
England, although not to the injury of the English Church.
He protested against the confirmation of the statute of provisors
in 1390, and he was successful in slightly modifying the statute of
praemunire in 1393. Disliking the extravagance of Richard II.
he publicly reproved the king, and after an angry scene the royal
threats drove him for a time into Devonshire. In 1386 he was
one of the commissioners appointed to reform the kingdom and
the royal household, and in 1387 he arranged a peace between
Richard and his enemies under Thomas of Woodstock, duke of
Gloucester. Courtenay died at Maidstone on the 31st of July
1396, and was buried in Canterbury cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTESY<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (O. Fr. <i>curtesie</i>, later <i>courtoisie</i>), manners or
behaviour that suit a court, politeness, due consideration for
others. A special application of the word is in the expression
&ldquo;by courtesy,&rdquo; where something is granted out of favour and
not of right, hence &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; titles, <i>i.e.</i> those titles of rank
which are given by custom to the eldest sons of dukes, marquesses
and earls, usually the second title held by the father; to the
younger sons and to the daughters of dukes and marquesses,
viz. the prefix &ldquo;lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;lady&rdquo; with the Christian and
surname. For &ldquo;tenure by the courtesy&rdquo; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Curtesy</a></span>. Another
form of the word, &ldquo;curtsey&rdquo; or &ldquo;curtsy,&rdquo; was early confined
to the expression of courtesy or respect by a gesture or bow,
now only of the reverence made by a woman, consisting in a
bending of the knees accompanied by a lowering of the body.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTHOPE, WILLIAM JOHN<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), English writer
and historian of poetry, whose father was rector of South Malling,
Essex, was born on the 17th of July 1842. From Harrow school
he went to New College, Oxford; took first-classes in classical
&ldquo;moderations&rdquo; and &ldquo;greats&rdquo;; and won the Newdigate prize
for poetry (1864) and the Chancellor&rsquo;s English essay (1868).
He seemed destined for distinction as a poet, his volume of
<i>Ludibria Lunae</i> (1869) being followed in 1870 by the remarkably
fine <i>Paradise of Birds</i>. But a certain academic quality of mind
seemed to check his output in verse and divert it into the field
of criticism. Apart from many contributions to the higher
journalism, his literary career is associated mainly with his
continuation of the edition of Pope&rsquo;s works, begun by Whitwell
Elwin (1816-1900), which appeared in ten volumes from 1871-1889;
his life of Addison (Men of Letters series, 1882); his
<i>Liberal Movement in English Literature</i> (1885); and his tenure
of the professorship of Poetry at Oxford (1895-1901), which
resulted in his elaborate <i>History of English Poetry</i> (the first
volume appearing in 1895), and his <i>Life in Poetry</i> (1901). He
deals with the history of English poetry as a whole, and in its
unity as a result of the national spirit and thought in succeeding
ages, and attempts to bring the great poets into relation with
this. In 1887 he was appointed a civil service commissioner,
being first commissioner in 1892, and being made a C.B. He
was made an honorary fellow of his old college at Oxford in 1896,
and was given the honorary degrees of D.Litt. by Durham in
1895 and of LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1898.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURT LEET<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span>, an English petty criminal court for the punishment
of small offences. It has been usual to make a distinction
between court baron and court leet<a name="FnAnchor_1d" id="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> as being separate courts,
but in the early history of the court leet no such distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
can be drawn. At a very early time the lords of manors exercised
or claimed certain jurisdictional franchises. Of these the most
important was the &ldquo;view of frankpledge&rdquo; and its attendant
police jurisdiction. Some time in the later middle ages the
court baron when exercising these powers gained the name of
<i>leet</i>, and, later, of &ldquo;court leet.&rdquo; The <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings
of Edward I. established a sharp distinction between the court
baron, exercising strictly manorial rights, and the court leet,
depending for its jurisdiction upon royal franchise. The court
leet was a court of record, and its duty was not only to view the
pledges but to present by jury all crimes that might happen
within the jurisdiction, and punish the same. The steward of
the court acted as judge, presiding wholly in a judicial character,
the ministerial acts being executed by the bailiff. The court
leet began to decline in the 14th century, being superseded by
the more modern courts of the justices, but in many cases courts
leet were kept up until nearly the middle of the 19th century.
Indeed, it cannot be said that they are now actually extinct,
as many still survive for formal purposes, and by s. 40 of the
Sheriffs Act 1887 they are expressly kept up.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="Footnote_1d" id="Footnote_1d" href="#FnAnchor_1d"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The history of the word &ldquo;leet&rdquo; is very obscure. It appears in
Anglo-French documents as <i>lete</i> and in Anglo-Latin as <i>leta</i>. Professor
W. W. Skeat has connected it with Old English <i>láetan</i>, to let,
which is very doubtful, though this is the origin of the use of the
word in such expressions as &ldquo;two-&rdquo; &ldquo;three-way leet,&rdquo; a place
where cross-roads meet. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> suggests a
connexion with &ldquo;lathe,&rdquo; a term which survives as a division of the
county of Kent, containing several &ldquo;hundreds.&rdquo; This is of Old
Norwegian origin, and seems to have meant &ldquo;landed possessions.&rdquo;
There is also another Old Norwegian <i>léith</i>, a court or judicial assembly,
and modern Danish has <i>laegd</i>, a division of the country for military
purposes. J. H. Round (<i>Feudal England</i>, p. 101) points out that the
Suffolk hundred was divided for assessment into equal blocks called
&ldquo;leets&rdquo; (see further F. W. Maitland, <i>Select Pleas in Manorial Courts</i>,
Selden Soc. Publications I. lxxiii-lxxvi). &ldquo;Leet&rdquo; is also used, chiefly
in Scotland, for a list of persons nominated for election to an office.
This is, apparently, a shortened form of the French <i>élite</i>, elected.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURT-MARTIAL,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> a court for the trial of offences against
military or naval discipline, or for the administration of martial
law. In England courts-martial have inherited part of the
jurisdiction of the old <i>Curia militaris</i>, or court of the chivalry,
in which a single marshal and at one time the high constable
proceeded &ldquo;according to the customs and usages of that court,
and, in cases omitted according to the civil law, <i>secundum legem
armorum</i>&rdquo; (Coke, 4 <i>Ins.</i> 17). The modern form of the courts
was adopted by ordinance in the time of Charles I., when English
soldiers were studying the &ldquo;articles and military laws&rdquo; of
Gustavus Adolphus and the Dutch military code of Arnheim;
it is first recognized by statute in the first Mutiny Act of 1689.
The Mutiny Act (with various extensions and amendments)
and the statutory articles of war continued to be the sources
of military law which courts-martial administered until 1879,
when they were codified in the Army Discipline and Regulation
Act 1879, which was, in turn, superseded by the Army Act 1881.
This act is re-enacted annually by the Army (Annual) Act.
The constitution of courts-martial, their procedure, &amp;c., are
dealt with under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Military Law</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Naval Courts-Martial.</i>&mdash;The administration of the barbarous
naval law of England was long entrusted to the discretion of
commanders acting under instructions from the lord high
admiral, who was supreme over both the royal and merchant
navy. It was the leaders of the Long Parliament who first
secured something like a regular tribunal by passing in 1645
an ordinance and articles concerning martial law for the government
of the navy. Under this ordinance Blake, Monk and Penn
issued instructions for the holding general and ship courts-martial
with written records, the one for captains and commanders,
the other for subordinate officers and men. Of the
latter the mate, gunner and boatswain were members, but the
admirals reserved a control over the more serious sentences.
Under an act of 1661 the high admiral again received power
to issue commissions for holding courts-martial&mdash;a power which
continues to be exercised by the board of admiralty. During
the 18th century, under the auspices of Anson, the jurisdiction
was greatly extended, and the Consolidation Act of 1749 was
passed in which the penalty of death occurs as frequently as the
curses in the commination service. The Naval Articles of War
have always been statutory, and the whole system may now be
said to rest on the Naval Discipline Act 1866, as amended by the
act of 1884. The navy has its courts of inquiry for the confidential
investigation of charges &ldquo;derogatory to the character
of an officer and a gentleman.&rdquo; Under the act of 1866 a court-martial
must consist of from five to nine officers of a certain
rank, and must be held publicly on board of one of H.M. ships
of war, and where at least two such ships are together. The
rank of the president depends on that of the prisoner. A judge-advocate
attends, and the procedure resembles that in military
courts, except that the prisoner is not asked to plead, and the
sentence, if not one of death, does not require the confirmation
of the commander-in-chief abroad or of the admiralty at home.
The court has a large and useful power of finding the prisoner
guilty of a less serious offence than that charged, which might
well be imitated in the ordinary criminal courts. The death
sentence is always carried out by hanging at the yard-arm;
Admiral Byng, however, was shot in 1757. The board of
admiralty have, under the Naval Discipline Acts, a general
power of suspending, annulling, and modifying sentences which
are not capital. The jurisdiction extends to all persons belonging
to the navy, to land forces and other passengers on board, shipwrecked
crews, spies, persons borne on the books of H.M. ships
in commission, and civilians on board who endeavour to seduce
others from allegiance. The definition of the jurisdiction by
locality includes harbours, havens or creeks, lakes or rivers,
in or out of the United Kingdom; all places within the jurisdiction
of the admiralty; all places on shore out of the United
Kingdom; the dockyards, barracks, hospitals, &amp;c., of the
service wherever situated; all places on shore in or out of the
United Kingdom for all offences punishable under the Articles
of War except those specified in section 38 of the Naval Discipline
Act 1860, which are punishable by ordinary law. The Royal
Marines, while borne on the books of H.M. ships, are subject
to the Naval Discipline Acts, and, by an order in council, 1882,
when they are embarked on board ship for service on shore;
otherwise they are under the Army Acts. By s. 179, sub.-sec.
7, of the Army Act, in the application of the act to the Royal
Marines the admiralty is substituted for military authorities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURTNEY, LEONARD HENRY COURTNEY,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1832-&emsp;&emsp;),
English politician and man of letters, eldest son of J. S.
Courtney, a banker, was born at Penzance on the 6th of July
1832. At Cambridge, Leonard Courtney was second wrangler
and first Smith&rsquo;s prizeman, and was elected a fellow of his college,
St John&rsquo;s. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1858,
was professor of political economy at University College from
1872 to 1875, and in December 1876, after a previous unsuccessful
attempt, was elected to parliament for Liskeard in the Liberal
interest. He continued to represent the borough, and the
district into which it was merged by the Reform Act of 1885,
until 1900, when his attitude towards the South African War&mdash;he
was one of the foremost of the so-called &ldquo;Pro-Boer&rdquo; party&mdash;compelled
his retirement. Until 1885 he was a devoted adherent
of Mr Gladstone, particularly in finance and foreign affairs.
In 1880 he was under-secretary of state for the home department,
in 1881 for the colonies, and in 1882 secretary to the treasury;
but he was always a stubborn fighter for principle, and upon
finding that the government&rsquo;s Reform Bill in 1884 contained
no recognition of the scheme for proportional representation,
to which he was deeply committed, he resigned office. He
refused to support Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s Home Rule Bill in 1885, and
was one of those who chiefly contributed to its rejection, and
whose reputation for unbending integrity and intellectual
eminence gave solidity to the Liberal Unionist party. In 1886
he was elected chairman of committees in the House of Commons,
and his efficiency in this office seemed to mark him out for the
speakership in 1895. A Liberal Unionist, however, could only
be elected by Conservative votes, and he had made himself
objectionable to a large section of the party by his independent
attitude on various questions, on which his Liberalism outweighed
his party loyalty. He would in any case have been incapacitated
by an affection of the eyesight, which for a while threatened
to withdraw him from public life altogether. After 1895 Mr
Courtney&rsquo;s divergences from the Unionist party on questions
other than Irish politics became gradually more marked. He
became known in the House of Commons principally for his
candid criticism of the measures introduced by his nominal
leaders, and he was rather to be ranked among the Opposition
than as a Ministerialist; and when the crisis with the Transvaal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
came in 1899, Mr Courtney&rsquo;s views, which remained substantially
what they were when he supported the settlement after Majuba
in 1881, had plainly become incompatible with his position even
as a nominal follower of Lord Salisbury and Mr Chamberlain.
He gradually reverted to formal membership of the Liberal
party, and in January 1906 unsuccessfully contested a division
of Edinburgh as a supporter of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
at the general election. Among the birthday honours of 1906
he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Courtney of Penwith
(Cornwall). Lord Courtney, who in 1883 married Miss Catherine
Potter (an elder sister of Mrs Sidney Webb), was a prominent
supporter of the women&rsquo;s movement. In earlier years he was a
regular contributor to <i>The Times</i>, and he wrote numerous essays
in the principal reviews on political and economic subjects.
In 1901 he published a book on <i>The Working Constitution of the
United Kingdom</i>.</p>

<p>Two of his brothers, John Mortimer Courtney (b. 1838), and
William Prideaux Courtney (b. 1845), also attained public distinction,
the former in the government service in Canada (from
1869, retiring in 1906), rising to be deputy-minister of finance,
and the latter in the British civil service (1865-1892), and as a
prominent man of letters and bibliographer.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURTOIS, JACQUES<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1621-1676) and <b>GUILLAUME</b> (1628-1679).
The two French painters who bore these names are also
called by the Italian equivalents Giacomo (or Jacopo) Cortese
and Guglielmo Cortese. Each of the brothers is likewise named,
from his native province, Le Bourguignon, or Il Borgognone.</p>

<p>Jacques Courtois was born at St Hippolyte, near Besançon, in
1621. His father was a painter, and with him Jacques remained
studying up to the age of fifteen. Towards 1637 he came to Italy,
was hospitably received at Milan by a Burgundian gentleman,
and entered, and for three years remained in, the French military
service. The sight of some battle-pictures revived his taste for
fine art. He went to Bologna, and studied under the friendly
tutelage of Guido; thence he proceeded to Rome, where he
painted, in the Cistercian monastery, the &ldquo;Miracle of the Loaves.&rdquo;
Here he took a house and after a while entered upon his own
characteristic style of art, that of battle-painting, in which he has
been accounted to excel all other old masters; his merits were
cordially recognized by the celebrated Cerquozzi, named Michelangelo
delle Battaglie. He soon rose from penury to ease, and
married a painter&rsquo;s beautiful daughter, Maria Vagini; she died
after seven years of wedded life. Prince Matthias of Tuscany
employed Courtois on some striking works in his villa, Lappeggio,
representing with much historical accuracy the prince&rsquo;s military
exploits. In Venice also the artist executed for the senator
Sagredo some remarkable battle-pieces. In Florence he entered
the Society of Jesus, taking the habit in Rome in 1655; it was
calumniously rumoured that he adopted this course in order to
escape punishment for having poisoned his wife. As a Jesuit
father, Courtois painted many works in churches and monasteries
of the society. He lived piously in Rome, and died there of apoplexy
on the 20th of May 1676 (some accounts say 1670 or 1671).
His battle-pieces have movement and fire, warm colouring (now
too often blackened), and great command of the brush,&mdash;those of
moderate dimensions are the more esteemed. They are slight
in execution, and tell out best from a distance. Courtois etched
with skill twelve battle-subjects of his own composition. The
Dantzig painter named in Italy Pandolfo Reschi was his pupil.</p>

<p>Guillaume Courtois, born likewise at St Hippolyte, came to
Italy with his brother. He went at once to Rome, and entered
the school of Pietro da Cortona. He studied also the Bolognese
painters and Giovanni Barbieri, and formed for himself a style
with very little express mannerism, partly resembling that of
Maratta. He painted the &ldquo;Battle of Joshua&rdquo; in the Quirinal
Gallery, the &ldquo;Crucifixion of St Andrew&rdquo; in the church of that
saint on Monte Cavallo, various works for the Jesuits, some also
in co-operation with his brother. His last production was
Christ admonishing Martha. His draughtsmanship is better than
that of Jacques, whom he did not, however, rival in spirit,
colour or composition. He also executed some etchings.
Guillaume Courtois died of gout on the 15th of June 1679.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COURTRAI<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (Flemish, <i>Kortryk</i>), an important and once famous
town of West Flanders, Belgium, situated on the Lys. Pop.
(1904) 34,564. It is now best known for its fine linen, which
ranks with that of Larne. The lace factories are also important
and employ 5000 hands. But considerable as is the prosperity of
modern Courtrai it is but a shadow of what it was in the middle
ages during the halcyon period of the Flemish communes. Then
Courtrai had a population of 200,000, now it is little over a sixth
of that number. On the 11th of July 1302 the great battle of
Courtrai (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infantry</a></span>) was fought outside its walls, when the
French army, under the count of Artois, was vanquished by the
allied burghers of Bruges, Ypres and Courtrai with tremendous
loss. As many as 700 pairs of golden spurs were collected on the
field from the bodies of French knights and hung up as an
offering in an abbey church of the town, which has long disappeared.
There are still, however, some interesting remains of
Courtrai&rsquo;s former grandeur. Perhaps the Pont de Broel, with its
towers at either end of the bridge, is as characteristic and
complete as any monument of ancient Flanders that has come
down to modern times. The hôtel de ville, which dated from the
earlier half of the 16th century, was restored in 1846, and since
then statues have also been added to represent those that
formerly ornamented the façade. Two richly and elaborately
carved chimney-pieces in the hôtel de ville merit special notice.
The one in the council chamber upstairs dates from 1527 and
gives an allegorical representation of the Virtues and the Vices.
The other, three-quarters of a century later, contains an heraldic
representation of the noble families of the town. The church of
St Martin dates from the 15th century, but was practically
destroyed in 1862 by a fire caused by lightning. It has been
restored. The most important building at Courtrai is the church
of Notre Dame, which was begun by Count Baldwin IX. in 1191
and finished in 1211. The portal and the choir were reconstructed
in the 18th century. In the chapel behind the choir is hung one
of Van Dyck&rsquo;s masterpieces, &ldquo;The Erection of the Cross.&rdquo; The
chapel of the counts attached to the church dates from 1373, and
contained mural paintings of the counts and countesses of
Flanders down to the merging of the title in the house of
Burgundy. Most if not all of these had become obliterated, but
they have now been carefully restored. With questionable
judgment portraits have been added of the subsequent holders of
the title down to the emperor Francis II. (I. of Austria), the last
representative of the houses of Flanders and Burgundy to rule
in the Netherlands. Courtrai celebrated the 600th anniversary
of the battle mentioned above by erecting a monument on the
field in 1902, and also by fêtes and historical processions that
continued for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Courtrai, the <i>Cortracum</i> of the Romans, ranked as a town from
the 7th century onwards. It was destroyed by the Normans, but
was rebuilt in the 10th century by Baldwin III. of Flanders,
who endowed it with market rights and laid the foundation of
its industrial importance by inviting the settlement of foreign
weavers. The town was once more burnt, in 1382, by the French
after the battle of Roosebeke, but was rebuilt in 1385 by Philip
the Bold, duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COURVOISIER, JEAN JOSEPH ANTOINE<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1775-1835),
French magistrate and politician, was born at Besançon on the
30th of November 1775. During the revolutionary period he
left the country and served in the army of the <i>émigrés</i> and later
in that of Austria. In 1801, under the Consulate, he returned
to France and established himself as an advocate at Besançon,
being appointed <i>conseiller-auditeur</i> to the court of appeal there in
1808. At the Restoration he was made advocate-general by
Louis XVIII., resigned and left France during the Hundred Days,
and was reappointed after the second Restoration in 1815. In
1817, after the modification of the constitution by the <i>ordonnance</i>
of the 5th of September, he was returned to the chamber of
deputies, where he attached himself to the left centre and
supported the moderate policy of Richelieu and Decazes. He
was an eloquent speaker, and master of many subjects; and his
proved royalism made it impossible for the ultra-Royalists to
discredit him, much as they resented his consistent opposition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
their short-sighted violence. After the revolt at Lyons in 1817 he
was nominated <i>procureur-général</i> of the city, and by his sense
and moderation did much to restore order and confidence. He
was again a member of the chamber from 1819 to 1824, and
vigorously opposed the exceptional legislation which the second
administration of Richelieu passed under the influence of the
ultra-Royalists. In 1824 he failed to secure re-election, and
occupied himself with his judicial duties until his nomination as
councillor of state in 1827. On the 8th of August 1829 he
accepted the offer of the portfolio of justice in the Polignac
ministry, but resigned on the 19th of May 1830, when he realized
that the government intended to abrogate the Charter and the
inevitable revolution that would follow. During the trial of the
ex-ministers, in December, he was summoned as a witness, and
paid a tribute to the character of his former colleagues which,
under the circumstances, argued no little courage. He refused
to take office under Louis Philippe, and retired into private life,
dying on the 18th of September 1835.</p>

France. As a painter of subject pictures he is ranked as the
founder of the French school, as having first departed from the
practice of portraits. His &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; influenced by
Parmigiano, is in the Louvre, and a &ldquo;Descent from the Cross&rdquo;

known also as a sculptor, and an engraver, both in etching and
on wood, his wood-cuts for Jean le Clerc&rsquo;s Bible (1596) and
other books being his best-known work. He also wrote a <i>Livre
de perspective</i> (1560), and a <i>Livre de portraiture</i> (1571).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUSIN, VICTOR<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> (1792-1867), French philosopher, the son
of a watchmaker, was born in Paris, in the Quartier St Antoine,
on the 28th of November 1792. At the age of ten he was sent
to the grammar school of the Quartier St Antoine, the Lycée
Charlemagne. Here he studied until he was eighteen. The
lycée had a connexion with the university, and when Cousin
left the secondary school he was &ldquo;crowned&rdquo; in the ancient hall
of the Sorbonne for the Latin oration delivered by him there,
in the general concourse of his school competitors. The classical
training of the lycée strongly disposed him to literature. He
was already known among his compeers for his knowledge of
Greek. From the lycée he passed to the Normal School of Paris,
where Laromiguière was then lecturing on philosophy. In
the second preface to the <i>Fragmens philosophiques</i>, in which
he candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life,
Cousin speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the memory
of the day in 1811, when he heard Laromiguière for the first
time. &ldquo;That day decided my whole life. Laromiguière taught
the philosophy of Locke and Condillac, happily modified on
some points, with a clearness and grace which in appearance
at least removed difficulties, and with a charm of spiritual
<i>bonhomie</i> which penetrated and subdued.&rdquo; Cousin was set
forthwith to lecture on philosophy, and he speedily obtained
the position of master of conferences (<i>maître de conférences</i>) in
the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life
was the teaching of Royer-Collard. This teacher, as he tells
us, &ldquo;by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his
words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from
the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since
become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented,
that of the Scottish philosophy.&rdquo; In 1815-1816 Cousin attained
the position of <i>suppléant</i> (assistant) to Royer-Collard in the
history of modern philosophy chair of the faculty of letters.
There was still another thinker who influenced him at this early
period,&mdash;Maine de Biran, whom Cousin regarded as the unequalled
psychological observer of his time in France.</p>

<p>These men strongly influenced both the method and the
matter of Cousin&rsquo;s philosophical thought. To Laromiguière
he attributes the lesson of decomposing thought, even though
the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard
taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal
laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are
superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind.
De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will.
He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, and especially
in the simplest facts of consciousness, the fact of voluntary
activity, that activity in which our personality is truly revealed.
It was through this &ldquo;triple discipline,&rdquo; as he calls it, that
Cousin&rsquo;s philosophical thought was first developed, and that
in 1815 he entered on the public teaching of philosophy in the
Normal School and in the faculty of letters.<a name="FnAnchor_1e" id="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He then took up
the study of German, worked at Kant and Jacobi, and sought
to master the <i>Philosophy of Nature</i> of Schelling, by which he
was at first greatly attracted. The influence of Schelling may be
observed very markedly in the earlier form of his philosophy.
He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi, but regarded
it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded
in reason. In 1817 he went to Germany, and met Hegel at
Heidelberg. In this year appeared Hegel&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopädie der
philosophischen Wissenschaften</i>, of which Cousin had one of the
earliest copies. He thought Hegel not particularly amiable,
but the two became friends. The following year Cousin went to
Munich, where he met Schelling for the first time, and spent a
month with him and Jacobi, obtaining a deeper insight into the
<i>Philosophy of Nature</i>.</p>

<p>The political troubles of France interfered for a time with
his career. In the events of 1814-1815 he took the royalist side.
He at first adopted the views of the party known as
<i>doctrinaire</i>, of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical
<span class="sidenote">Political troubles.</span>
chief. He seems then to have gone farther
than his party, and even to have approached the extreme Left.
Then came a reaction against liberalism, and in 1821-1822
Cousin was deprived of his offices alike in the faculty of letters
and in the Normal School. The Normal School itself was swept
away, and Cousin shared at the hands of a narrow and illiberal
government the fate of Guizot, who was ejected from the chair
of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was
not wholly an evil. He set out for Germany with a view to
further philosophical study. While at Berlin in 1824-1825 he
was thrown into prison, either on some ill-defined political
charge at the instance of the French police, or on account of
certain incautious expressions which he had let fall in conversation.
Liberated after six months, he continued under the
suspicion of the French government for three years. It was
during this period, however, that he thought out and developed
what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism,
his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in
principle and in most of their salient details in the <i>Fragmens
philosophiques</i> (Paris, 1826). The preface to the
<span class="sidenote">Fragmens philosophiques.</span>
second edition (1833) and the <i>Avertissement</i> to the
third (1838) aimed at a vindication of his principles
against contemporary criticism. Even the best of his
later books, the <i>Philosophie écossaise</i> (4th ed., 1863), the <i>Du
vrai, du beau, et du bien</i> (12th ed., 1872; Eng. trans., 3rd ed.,
Edinburgh, 1854), and the <i>Philosophie de Locke</i> (4th ed., 1861)
were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period
from 1815 to 1820. The lectures on Locke were first sketched
in 1819, and fully developed in the course of 1829.</p>

<p>During the seven years of enforced abandonment of teaching
he produced, besides the <i>Fragmens</i>, the edition of the works
of Proclus (6 vols., 1820-1827), and the works of Descartes
(11 vols., 1826). He also commenced his <i>Translation of Plato</i>
(13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840.</p>

<p>We see in the <i>Fragmens</i> very distinctly the fusion of the
different philosophical influences by which his opinions were
finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit
of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
with the publication of the <i>Fragmens</i> of 1826 that the first great
widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the
<i>Cours de l&rsquo;histoire de la philosophie</i>.</p>

<p>In 1828 M. de Vatimesnil, minister of public instruction in
Martignac&rsquo;s ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their
professorial positions in the university. The three
years which followed were the period of Cousin&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Career as a lecturer.</span>
greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the
chair was the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas and
was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was
crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been
since the days of Abelard. The lecturer had a singular power
of identifying himself for the time with the system which he
expounded and the historical character he portrayed. Clear
and comprehensive in the grasp of the general outlines of his
subject, he was methodical and vivid in the representation of
details. In exposition he had the rare art of unfolding and
aggrandizing. There was a rich, deep-toned, resonant eloquence
mingled with the speculative exposition; his style of expression
was clear, elegant and forcible, abounding in happy turns and
striking antitheses. To this was joined a singular power of
rhetorical climax. His philosophy exhibited in a striking
manner the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and
its logical need of grouping details round central principles.</p>

<p>There was withal a moral elevation in his spiritual philosophy
which came home to the hearts of his hearers, and seemed to
afford a ground for higher development in national literature and
art, and even in politics, than the traditional philosophy of
France had appeared capable of yielding. His lectures produced
more ardent disciples, imbued at least with his spirit, than those
of any other professor of philosophy in France during the 18th
century. Tested by the power and effect of his teaching influence,
Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of
philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and Dugald Stewart
have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative
power. Tested even by the strength of the reaction which his
writings have in some cases occasioned, his influence is hardly less
remarkable. The taste for philosophy&mdash;especially its history&mdash;was
revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th
century.</p>

<p>Among the men who were influenced by Cousin we may note
T. S. Jouffroy, J. P. Damiron, Garnier, J. Barthélemy St Hilaire,
F. Ravaisson-Mollien, Rémusat, Jules Simon and
A. Franck. Jouffroy and Damiron were first fellow-students
<span class="sidenote">Disciples and followers.</span>
and then disciples. Jouffroy, however,
always kept firm to the early&mdash;the French and
Scottish&mdash;impulses of Cousin&rsquo;s teaching. Cousin continued to
lecture regularly for two years and a half after his return to the
chair. Sympathizing with the revolution of July, he was at once
recognized by the new government as a friend of national liberty.
Writing in June 1833 he explains both his philosophical and his
political position:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;I had the advantage of holding united against me for many
years both the sensational and the theological school. In 1830
both schools descended into the arena of politics. The sensational
school quite naturally produced the demagogic party, and the theological
school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to borrow
from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better
to reach its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes
to restore theocracy. On the other hand, he who combated
any exclusive principle in science was bound to reject also any exclusive
principle in the state, and to defend representative government.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The government was not slow to do him honour. He was
induced by the ministry of which his friend Guizot was the head
to become a member of the council of public instruction and
counsellor of state, and in 1832 he was made a peer of France.
He ceased to lecture, but retained the title of professor of
philosophy. Finally, he accepted the position of minister of
public instruction in 1840 under Thiers. He was besides director
of the Normal School and virtual head of the university, and from
1840 a member of the Institute (Academy of the Moral and
Political Sciences). His character and his official position at this
period gave him great power in the university and in the educational
arrangements of the country. In fact, during the seventeen
and a half years of the reign of Louis Philippe, Cousin mainly
moulded the philosophical and even the literary tendencies of the
cultivated class in France.</p>

<p>But the most important work he accomplished during this
period was the organization of primary instruction. It was to the
efforts of Cousin that France owed her advance, in
primary education, between 1830 and 1848. Prussia
<span class="sidenote">Relation to primary education in France.</span>
and Saxony had set the national example, and France
was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national
calamity and of personal wrong, he looked to Prussia as affording
the best example of an organized system of national education;
and he was persuaded that &ldquo;to carry back the education of
Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph
than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena.&rdquo; In the summer of
1831, commissioned by the government, he visited Frankfort and
Saxony, and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series
of reports to the minister, afterwards published as <i>Rapport sur
l&rsquo;état de l&rsquo;instruction publique dans quelques pays de l&rsquo;Allemagne
et particulièrement en Prusse</i>. (Compare also <i>De l&rsquo;instruction
publique en Hollande</i>, 1837.) His views were readily accepted on
his return to France, and soon afterwards through his influence
there was passed the law of primary instruction. (See his
<i>Exposé des motifs et projet de loi sur l&rsquo;instruction primaire,
présentés à la chambre des députés, séance du 2 janvier 1833</i>.)</p>

<p>In the words of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (July 1833), these
documents &ldquo;mark an epoch in the progress of national education,
and are directly conducive to results important not only to
France but to Europe.&rdquo; The <i>Report</i> was translated into English
by Mrs Sarah Austin in 1834. The translation was frequently
reprinted in the United States of America. The legislatures of
New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the schools at
the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that, among all the
literary distinctions which he had received, &ldquo;None has touched
me more than the title of foreign member of the American
Institute for Education.&rdquo; To the enlightened views of the
ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king, and to the
zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization, France
owes what is best in her system of primary education,&mdash;a national
interest which had been neglected under the Revolution, the
Empire and the Restoration (see <i>Exposé</i>, p. 17). In the first two
years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the
education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished
in all the history of France. In defence of university
studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844,
against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling
or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion
were published in a tractate <i>Défense de l&rsquo;université et de la
philosophie</i> (1844 and 1845).</p>

<p>This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 was spent, so far as
philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures
and writings, in maturing them for publication or
reissue, and in research into certain periods of the
<span class="sidenote">Philosophical writings.</span>
history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared <i>De la
Métaphysique d&rsquo;Aristote, suivi d&rsquo;un essai de traduction
des deux premiers livres</i>; in 1836, <i>Cours de philosophie professé à
la faculté des lettres pendant l&rsquo;année 1818</i>, and <i>Ouvrages inédits
d&rsquo;Abélard</i>. This <i>Cours de philosophie</i> appeared later in 1854 as
<i>Du vrai, du beau, et du bien</i>. From 1825 to 1840 appeared
<i>Cours de l&rsquo;histoire de la philosophie</i>, in 1829 <i>Manuel de l&rsquo;histoire de
la philosophie de Tennemann</i>, translated from the German. In
1840-1841 we have <i>Cours d&rsquo;histoire de la philosophie morale au
XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (5 vols.). In 1841 appeared his edition of the
<i>&OElig;uvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran</i>; in 1842, <i>Leçons de
philosophie sur Kant</i> (Eng. trans. A. G. Henderson, 1854), and in
the same year <i>Des Pensées de Pascal</i>. The <i>Nouveaux fragments</i>
were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later, in 1859,
appeared <i>Petri Abaelardi Opera</i>.</p>

<p>During this period Cousin seems to have turned with fresh
interest to those literary studies which he had abandoned for
speculation under the influence of Laromiguière and Royer-Collard.
To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men
<span class="sidenote">Literary studies.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results
of his work in this line, we have, besides the <i>Des Pensêes de
Pascal</i>, 1842, <i>Études sur les femmes et la société du
XVII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>, 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal
(1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de
Sablé (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de
Hautefort (1856).</p>

<p>When the reign of Louis Philippe came to a close through the
opposition of his ministry, with Guizot at its head, to the demand
for electoral reform and through the policy of the Spanish
marriages, Cousin, who was opposed to the government on these
points, lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the Provisional
government. He published a pamphlet entitled <i>Justice et
charité</i>, the purport of which showed the moderation of his
political views. It was markedly anti-socialistic. But from this
period he passed almost entirely from public life, and ceased to
wield the personal influence which he had done during the
preceding years. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 2nd of December,
he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the
superior council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the
Empire he stood aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with
Guizot and Villemain in the rank of honorary professors. His
sympathies were apparently with the monarchy, under certain
constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political
issues of the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his
lifetime, he says,&mdash;&ldquo;It conducts human societies to the true
republic, that dream of all generous souls, which in our time can
be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2e" id="FnAnchor_2e" href="#Footnote_2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>During the last years of his life he occupied a suite of rooms in
the Sorbonne, where he lived simply and unostentatiously. The
chief feature of the rooms was his noble library, the cherished
collection of a lifetime. He died at Cannes on the 13th of
January 1867, in his sixty-fifth year. In the front of the
Sorbonne, below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters, a
tablet records an extract from his will, in which he bequeaths
his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial
work and triumphs.</p>

<p><i>Philosophy.</i>&mdash;There are three distinctive points in Cousin&rsquo;s
philosophy. These are his method, the results of his method,
and the application of the method and its results to history,&mdash;especially
to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his
philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and
subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned
and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis,&mdash;in fact,
a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it
is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and
proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the
necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is
indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of
his system,&mdash;as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his
analysis of consciousness. These three points&mdash;the method, the
results, and the philosophy of history&mdash;are with him intimately
connected; they are developments in a natural order of sequence.
They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism
in history.</p>

<p>First, as to method. On no point has Cousin more strongly
insisted than the importance of method in philosophy. That
which he adopts, and the necessity of which he so
strongly proclaims, is the ordinary one of observation,
<span class="sidenote">Method.</span>
analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin
regards as that of the 18th century,&mdash;the method which Descartes
began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied,
though imperfectly, and which Reid and Kant used with more
success, yet not completely. He insists that this is the true
method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which
alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition
of the application of the method is that it shall not through
prejudice of system omit a single fact of consciousness. If the
authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all.
If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous
systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness,
<i>i.e.</i> consciousness itself, in their totality. The observational
method applied to consciousness gives us the science of psychology.
This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or
metaphysics&mdash;the science of being&mdash;and of the philosophy of
history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds
induction as the complement of his method, by which he means
inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness,
and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, viz.
those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as
thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off
very clearly, on the one hand from the deductive construction of
notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling
or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis
and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other,
from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of
which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and
merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism
so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What
Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he
finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or
universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the
function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions
and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him
philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is
simply the material on which the philosophical method works,
and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.</p>

<p>The three great results of psychological observation
<span class="sidenote">Results.</span>
are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason.</p>

<p>These three facts are different in character, but are not found
apart in consciousness. Sensations, or the facts of the sensibility,
are necessary; we do not impute them to ourselves. The facts of
reason are also necessary, and reason is not less independent of
the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone are marked
in the eyes of consciousness with the characters of imputability
and personality. The will alone is the person or <i>Me</i>. The me
is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness
is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between
two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we
apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves
from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which
does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason,
and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility
which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not
constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three
integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate
ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.</p>

<p>But there is a peculiarity in Cousin&rsquo;s doctrine of activity or
freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into
his system. This is the element of spontaneity in
volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is
<span class="sidenote">Spontaneity in will.</span>
new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being.
Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a
cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and
its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so,
although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, <i>i.e.</i>
reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination
we are free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind
of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet
free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously
first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition,
that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as
reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty
of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity;
it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the
poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the
ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously
and not after reflective deliberation.</p>

<p>But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive
principle of the philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to
us by psychological observation, the reason of our consciousness,
is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it; its character
<span class="sidenote">Impersonality of reason.</span>
is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles
in knowledge is the essential point in psychology; it ought to
be put first and emphasized to the last that these
exist, and that they are wholly impersonal or absolute.
The number of these principles, their enumeration
and classification, is an important point, but it is
secondary to that of the recognition of their true nature. This
was the point which Kant missed in his analysis, and this is the
fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the
integrity of philosophy by the method of the observation of
consciousness. And how is this impersonality or absoluteness of
the conditions of knowledge to be established? The answer is in
substance that Kant went wrong in putting necessity first as the
criterion of those laws. This brought them within the sphere of
reflection, and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of
thinking them reversed; and led to their being regarded as
wholly relative to human intelligence, restricted to the sphere of
the phenomenal, incapable of revealing to us substantial reality&mdash;necessary,
yet subjective. But this test of necessity is a wholly
secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they
are each and all given to us, given to our consciousness, in an
act of spontaneous apperception or apprehension, immediately,
instantaneously, in a sphere above the reflective consciousness,
yet within the reach of knowledge. And &ldquo;all subjectivity with
all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The
reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free
self; but in itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that
self in humanity; it belongs not even to humanity. We may say
with truth that nature and humanity belong to it, for without
its laws both would perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what is the number of those laws? Kant reviewing the
enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list
of the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification
and may be legitimately reduced. According to
<span class="sidenote">Laws of reason.</span>
Cousin, there are but two primary laws of thought, that
of causality and that of substance. From these flow naturally
all the others. In the order of nature, that of substance is the
first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our
knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given
us in each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness.</p>

<p>These principles of reason, cause and substance, given thus
psychologically, enable us to pass beyond the limits of the
relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality,&mdash;enable
us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge,
to ontology or the science of being. These laws are
inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and
sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and
they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause,
and to an impersonal reality, a not-me&mdash;nature, the world of
force&mdash;lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself
the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the
sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is,
to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my
own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is
as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality,
and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective
impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my
sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other
is the order of the universe.</p>

<p>But these two forces, the me and the not-me, are reciprocally
limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous
phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us
immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct
<span class="sidenote">The infinite or absolute.</span>
causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, to which
they are related, so, from the notion of this limitation,
we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a
supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last
cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these
are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and
is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived
under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world.
He is absolute substance only in so far as he is absolute cause,
and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus
creates, and he creates necessarily.</p>

<p>This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to
the charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be
summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the
deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God.
<span class="sidenote">Charge of Pantheism.</span>
But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self
from each other and from the infinite cause. They
are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with
Spinoza,&mdash;they are free forces having their power or spring of
action in themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of
independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of
these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for
is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of the
Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or
plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain
is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and
the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As
to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating,
this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity,
activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a
struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited
manner; the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the
freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with
the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part.
He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action
excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the
mechanical operation of necessity.</p>

<p>The elements found in consciousness are also to be found in
the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In
external nature there are expansion and contraction
which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External
<span class="sidenote">History of philosophy.</span>
nature again in contrast with humanity expresses
spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In
human history the East represents the spontaneous stage;
the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection.</p>

<p>This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully
expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development
has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage,
where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect,
humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is
preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage,
mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly
or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only
or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite.
Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated.
Mind realizes another power in the universe. The
finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation
of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of
development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As
philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three
moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies
the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern
era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In
theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs
results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have
in correspondence also with the idea, monarchy, democracy,
constitutionalism.</p>

<p>Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological
method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various
systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, scepticism,
mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the
<span class="sidenote">Eclecticism.</span>
result was reached &ldquo;that each system expresses an
order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but
which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same time
holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it
follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that
in re-uniting all incomplete systems, we should have a complete
philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness.&rdquo; Philosophy,
as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of
systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the
truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span></p>

<p>Such is the system in outline. The historical position of the
system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin
was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned
in the form of infinite or absolute cause is but
<span class="sidenote">Relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel.</span>
a mere unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of
the mind, something different from a mere negation,
yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the
absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the
intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with
Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.</p>

<p>With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme
ground of all as positively apprehended, and as a source of
development, but he utterly repudiates Schelling&rsquo;s method.
The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness,
or it does not. If not, how do you know it and its object
which are identical? If it does, it comes within the sphere of
psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made
by Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling&rsquo;s intellectual
intuition is the mere negation of knowledge.</p>

<p>Again the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction,&mdash;a
hypothesis illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought
to vindicate. The very point to be established is the possibility
of reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian
system this is the very thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides
this, of course, objections might be made to the method of
development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction,
but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or
developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality.
The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness,
the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated,
illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily developed, are equally
useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding
by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of
consciousness,&mdash;in psychology.</p>

<p>The absolute or infinite&mdash;the unconditioned ground and source
of all reality&mdash;is yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum
or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousness&mdash;under its
condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object,
knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by
Sir W. Hamilton in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of 1829, and it was
animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling.
Hamilton&rsquo;s objections are as follows. The correlation of the
ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their
correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption
that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of
the same&mdash;that the finite and infinite are simply contradictory
relatives. Of these &ldquo;the positive alone is real, the negative is
only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality
even an abstraction of thought itself.&rdquo; A study of the few
sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling
criticism of Hamilton&rsquo;s objection which has been set afloat
recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite
implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny
the reality of that which you do not know? The answer to this
is that in the case of contradictory statements&mdash;A and not A&mdash;the
latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing;
and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the
finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as
an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily
known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that
needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory
negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may
not correspond to a positive&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> an object or notion with
qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation
of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known
beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is
one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes
the whole of the <i>Logic</i>. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence,
which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge
of the absolute&mdash;they are held to be incompatible with its
unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin&rsquo;s absolute
is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce
the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he
makes it an absolute cause, <i>i.e.</i> a cause existing absolutely under
relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its
effects, and dependent for reality on these&mdash;in a word, a mere
potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes
creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine.
Cousin made no reply to Hamilton&rsquo;s criticism beyond alleging
that Hamilton&rsquo;s doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge
and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics
by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest
sphere&mdash;theodicy.</p>

<p>The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal
by professing to find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception,
and above reflective necessity, can hardly be
regarded as successful. It may be that we first of all
<span class="sidenote">Criticism of his philosophy. Impersonality of reason.</span>
primitively or spontaneously affirm cause, substance,
time, space, &amp;c., in this way. But these are still in
each instance given us as realized in a particular form.
In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance,
much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality
of their application. We might thus get particular instances or
cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves
in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. And as
they are not supposed to be mere generalizations from experience,
no amount of individual instances of the application of any one
of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure
test we have of their universality in our experience is the test
of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on
reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere
spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is
grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality.
How far and in what sense this ground of necessity
renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.</p>

<p>But if these three correlative facts are immediately given, it
seems to be thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in
reflective consciousness. He seeks to trace the steps which the
reason has spontaneously and consciously, but irreflectively,
followed. And here the question arises&mdash;Can we vindicate in a
reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of
reality?</p>

<p>The self is found to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the
ground that we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness
to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from
the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting
or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle
of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If
self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality
to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us
either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less
as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant
a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause.
And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as
universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality
or will as the ultimate cause of its effect&mdash;volition. Once
applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first
antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further
cause or ground&mdash;in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.</p>

<p>The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to
the influence of a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to
our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation
as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it
be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being
independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause
there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this
cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently
of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us,
for the simple reason that such a notion is not supposed to exist
in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of
our notions,&mdash;cannot add to the number of realities we know.
All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is
of a given change, but <i>what</i> that cause is it cannot of itself inform
us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be adequate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far
as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from
a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon
us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such
a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within
the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know
such a reality&mdash;a will&mdash;in our own consciousness. When Cousin
thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up
the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in
question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension.
The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute
cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self.
Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme
reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the
principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism;
we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or
finite.</p>

<p>The truth is that Cousin&rsquo;s doctrine of the spontaneous apperception
of impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment
in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions
and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary
stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to co-ordinate
or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate
apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative
notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions
of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to
reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other.
And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence
and being&mdash;whether and how we are to relate our fundamental,
intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our
experience, or to an infinite being&mdash;are problems which Cousin
cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the
outstanding problems of modern philosophy.</p>

<p>Cousin&rsquo;s doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said
to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through
spontaneous apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated
volition may be the earliest and the most artistic,
<span class="sidenote">Volition.</span>
but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between
alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because
it is most rational. Aristotle touched this point in his distinction
between <span class="grk" title="boulêsis">&#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="proairesis">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>. The sudden and unpremeditated
wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in
character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined
by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what
is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of
wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes
beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of
the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and
illumining reflective activity.</p>

<p>Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding
without a system or test in determining the complete
or incomplete. But it is open to the objection of
assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has
<span class="sidenote">General estimate.</span>
reached all the possible elements in humanity and in
history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can
history have that which is not in the individual consciousness?
In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there,
and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula
on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place
true and original elements, and combinations of elements in
man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of
applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the
elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order,
whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at
any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative,
as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the
question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up
in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be non-existent
or impossible.</p>

<p>It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline
things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative
interest. This is necessarily the case, especially in the application
to history of all formulas supposed to be derived either from an
analysis of consciousness, or from an abstraction called pure
thought. Cousin was observational and generalizing rather than
analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not
profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development
was not remarkable. He left no distinctive permanent principle
of philosophy. But he left very interesting psychological
analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical
systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers
of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive
power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim,&mdash;far above
priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar
with the broad lines of nearly every system of philosophy ancient
and modern. His eclecticism was the proof of a reverential
sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to
certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was
eminently a doctrine of comprehension and of toleration. In
these respects it formed a marked and valuable contrast to the
arrogance of absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism,
and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological
school of his day. His spirit, while it influenced the youth
of France, saved them from these influences. As an educational
reformer, as a man of letters and learning, who trod &ldquo;the large
and impartial ways of knowledge,&rdquo; and who swayed others to the
same paths, as a thinker influential alike in the action and the
reaction to which he led, Cousin stands out conspicuously among
the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.</p>

<p>Sir W. Hamilton (<i>Discussions</i>, p. 541), one of his most resolute
opponents, described Cousin as &ldquo;A profound and original thinker,
a lucid and eloquent writer, a scholar equally at home in ancient
and in modern learning, a philosopher superior to all prejudices
of age or country, party or profession, and whose lofty eclecticism,
seeking truth under every form of opinion, traces its unity even
through the most hostile systems.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUSIN<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (Fr. <i>cousin</i>, Ital. <i>cugino</i>, Late Lat. <i>cosinus</i>, perhaps
a popular and familiar abbreviation of <i>consobrinus</i>, which has the
same sense in classical Latin), a term of relationship. Children
of brothers and sisters are to each other first cousins, or cousins-german;
the children of first cousins are to each other second
cousins, and so on; the child of a first cousin is to the first cousin
of his father or mother a first cousin once removed.</p>

<p>The word cousin has also, since the 16th century, been used
by sovereigns as an honorific style in addressing persons of
exalted, but not equal sovereign, rank, the term &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
being reserved as the style used by one sovereign in addressing
another. Thus, in Great Britain, dukes, marquesses and earls
are addressed by the sovereign in royal writs, &amp;c., as &ldquo;cousin.&rdquo;
In France the kings thus addressed princes of the blood royal,
cardinals and archbishops, dukes and peers, the marshals of
France, the grand officers of the crown and certain foreign
princes. In Spain the right to be thus addressed is a privilege of
the grandees.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUSINS, SAMUEL<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (1801-1887), English mezzotint engraver,
was born at Exeter on the 9th of May 1801. He was preeminently
the interpreter of Sir Thomas Lawrence, his contemporary.
During his apprenticeship to S. W. Reynolds he
engraved many of the best amongst the three hundred and sixty
little mezzotints illustrating the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds
which his master issued in his own name. In the finest of his
numerous transcripts of Lawrence, such as &ldquo;Lady Acland and
her Sons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pope Pius VII.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master Lambton,&rdquo; the
distinguishing characteristics of the engraver&rsquo;s work, brilliancy
and force of effect in a high key, corresponded exactly with
similar qualities in the painter. After the introduction of steel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
for engraving purposes about the year 1823, Cousins and his
contemporaries were compelled to work on it, because the soft
copper previously used for mezzotint plates did not yield a
sufficient number of fine impressions to enable the method to
compete commercially against line engraving, from which much
larger editions were obtainable. The painter-like quality which
distinguished the 18th-century mezzotints on copper was wanting
in his later works, because the hardness of the steel on which
they were engraved impaired freedom of execution and richness
of tone, and so enhanced the labour of scraping that he accelerated
the work by stipple, etching the details instead of scraping them
out of the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; in the manner of his predecessors. To
this &ldquo;mixed style,&rdquo; previously used by Richard Earlom on
copper, Cousins added heavy roulette and rocking-tool textures,
tending to fortify the darks, when he found that the &ldquo;burr&rdquo;
even on steel failed to yield enough fine impressions to meet the
demand. The effect of his prints in this method after Reynolds
and Millais was mechanical and out of harmony with the
picturesque technique of these painters, but the phenomenal
popularity which Cousins gained for his works at least kept alive
and in favour a form of mezzotint engraving during a critical
phase of its history. Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver,
dated the decline of his own art in England from the appearance
in 1837 of Cousins&rsquo;s print (in the &ldquo;mixed style&rdquo;) after Landseer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Bolton Abbey.&rdquo; Such plates as &ldquo;Miss Peel,&rdquo; after Lawrence
(published in 1833); &ldquo;A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; after
Landseer (1857); &ldquo;The Order of Release&rdquo; and &ldquo;The First
Minuet,&rdquo; after Millais (1856 and 1868); &ldquo;The Strawberry Girl&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Lavinia, Countess Spencer,&rdquo; after Reynolds; and &ldquo;Miss
Rich,&rdquo; after Hogarth (1873-1877), represent various stages
of Cousins&rsquo;s mixed method. It reached its final development
in the plates after Millais&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cherry Ripe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pomona,&rdquo;
published in 1881 and 1882, when the invention of coating
copper-plates with a film of steel to make them yield larger
editions led to the revival of pure mezzotint on copper, which
has since rendered obsolete the steel plate and the mixed style
which it fostered. The fine draughtsmanship of Cousins was as
apparent in his prints as in his original lead-pencil portraits
exhibited in London in 1882. In 1885 he was elected a full
member of the Royal Academy, to which institution he later gave
in trust £15,000 to provide annuities for superannuated artists
who had not been so successful as himself. One of the most
important figures in the history of British engraving, he died in
London, unmarried, on the 7th of May 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUSTOU,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> the name of a famous family of French sculptors.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Nicolas Coustou</span> (1658-1733) was the son of a wood-carver at
Lyons, where he was born. At eighteen he removed to Paris,
to study under C. A. Coysevox, his mother&rsquo;s brother, who
presided over the recently-established Academy of Painting and
Sculpture; and at three-and-twenty he gained the Colbert
prize, which entitled him to four years&rsquo; education at the French
Academy at Rome. He afterwards became rector and chancellor
of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. From the year 1700
he was a most active collaborator with Coysevox at the palaces
of Marly and Versailles. He was remarkable for his facility;
and though he was specially influenced by Michelangelo and
Algardi, his numerous works are among the most typical specimens
of his age now extant. The most famous are &ldquo;La Seine et
la Marne,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Saône,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Berger Chasseur&rdquo; in the gardens
of the Tuileries, the bas-relief &ldquo;Le Passage du Rhin&rdquo; in the
Louvre, and the &ldquo;Descent from the Cross&rdquo; placed behind the
choir altar of Notre Dame at Paris.</p>

<p>His younger brother, <span class="sc">Guillaume Coustou</span> (1677-1746), was
a sculptor of still greater merit. He also gained the Colbert
prize; but refusing to submit to the rules of the Academy, he
soon left it, and for some time wandered houseless through the
streets of Rome. At length he was befriended by the sculptor
Legros, under whom he studied for some time. Returning to Paris,
he was in 1704 admitted into the Academy of Painting and
Sculpture, of which he afterwards became director; and, like
his brother, he was employed by Louis XIV. His finest works
are the famous group of the &ldquo;Horse Tamers,&rdquo; originally at
Marly, now in the Champs Elysées at Paris, the colossal group
&ldquo;The Ocean and the Mediterranean&rdquo; at Marly, the bronze
&ldquo;Rhône&rdquo; which formed part of the statue of Louis XIV. at
Lyons, and the sculptures at the entrance of the Hôtel des
Invalides. Of these latter, the bas-relief representing Louis
XIV. mounted and accompanied by Justice and Prudence was
destroyed during the Revolution, but was restored in 1815 by
Pierre Cartellier from Coustou&rsquo;s model; the bronze figures of
Mars and Minerva, on either side of the doorway, were not
interfered with.</p>

<p>Another <span class="sc">Guillaume Coustou</span> (1716-1777), the son of Nicolas,
also studied at Rome, as winner of the Colbert prize. While
to a great extent a copyist of his predecessors, he was much
affected by the bad taste of his time, and produced little or
nothing of permanent value.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUTANCES, WALTER OF<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (d. 1207), bishop of Lincoln and
archbishop of Rouen, commenced his career in the chancery of
Henry II., was elected bishop of Lincoln in 1182, and in 1184
obtained, with the king&rsquo;s help, the see of Rouen. Throughout
his career he was much employed in diplomatic and administrative
duties. He started with Richard I. for the Third Crusade,
but was sent back from Messina to investigate the charges which
the barons and the official class had brought against the chancellor,
William Longchamp. There was no love lost between
the two; and they were popularly supposed to be rivals for
the see of Canterbury. The archbishop of Rouen sided with the
barons and John, and sanctioned Longchamp&rsquo;s deposition&mdash;a
step which was technically warranted by the powers which
Richard had given, but by no means calculated to protect the
interests of the crown. The Great Council now recognized the
archbishop as chief justiciar, and he remained at the head of the
government till 1193, when he was replaced by Hubert Walter.
The archbishop did good service in the negotiations for Richard&rsquo;s
release, but subsequently quarrelled with his master and laid
Normandy under an interdict, because the border stronghold
of Château Gaillard in the Vexin had been built on his land
without his consent. After Richard&rsquo;s death the archbishop
accepted John as the lawful heir of Normandy and consecrated
him as duke. But his personal inclinations leaned to Arthur
of Brittany, whom he was with difficulty dissuaded from supporting.
The archbishop accepted the French conquest of Normandy
with equanimity (1204), although he kept to his old allegiance
while the issue of the struggle was in doubt. He did not long
survive the conquest, and his later history is a blank.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUTANCES,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> a town of north-western France, capital of an
arrondissement of the department of Manche, 7 m. E. of the
English Channel and 58 m. S. of Cherbourg on the Western
railway. Pop. (1906) 6089. Coutances is beautifully situated
on the right bank of the Soulle on a granitic eminence crowned
by the celebrated cathedral of Notre-Dame. The date of this
church has been much disputed, but while traces of Romanesque
architecture survive, the building is, in the main, Gothic in
style and dates from the first half of the 13th century. The
slender turrets massed round the western towers and the octagonal
central tower, which forms a lantern within, are conspicuous
features of the church. In the interior, which comprises the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
nave with aisles, transept and choir with ambulatory and side
chapels, there are fine rose-windows with stained glass of the
14th century, and other works of art. Of the other buildings of
Coutances the church of St Pierre, in which Renaissance architecture
is mingled with Gothic, and that of St Nicolas, of the
16th and 17th centuries, demand mention. There is an aqueduct
of the 14th century to the west of the town. Coutances is a quiet
town with winding streets and pleasant boulevards bordering
it on the east; on the western slope of the hill there is a public
garden. The town is the seat of a bishop, a court of assizes and
a sub-prefect; it has tribunals of first instance and of commerce,
a lycée for boys, a communal college and a training college for
girls, and an ecclesiastical seminary. Leather-dressing and
wool-spinning are carried on and there is trade in live-stock, in
agricultural produce, especially eggs, and in marble.</p>

<p>Coutances is the ancient <i>Cosedia</i>, which before the Roman
conquest was one of the chief towns in the country of the Unelli.
Towards the end of the 3rd century its name was changed to
<i>Constantia</i>, in honour of the emperor Constantius Chlorus, who
fortified it. It became the capital of the <i>pagus Constantinus</i>
(Cotentin), and in the middle ages was the seat of a viscount.
It has been an episcopal see since the 5th century. In the 17th
century it was the centre of the revolt of the <i>Nu-pieds</i>, caused
by the imposition of the salt-tax (<i>gabelle</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUTHON, GEORGES<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1755-1794), French revolutionist,
was born at Orcet, a village in the district of Clermont in
Auvergne. He studied law, and was admitted advocate at
Clermont in 1785. At this period he was noted for his integrity,
gentle-heartedness and charitable disposition. His health was
feeble and both legs were paralysed. In 1787 he was a member
of the provincial assembly of Auvergne. On the outbreak of
the Revolution Couthon, who was now a member of the municipality
of Clermont-Ferrand, published his <i>L&rsquo;Aristocrate converti</i>,
in which he revealed himself as a liberal and a champion of
constitutional monarchy. He became very popular, was appointed
president of the tribunal of the town of Clermont in
1791, and in September of the same year was elected deputy to
the Legislative Assembly. His views had meanwhile been
embittered by the attempted flight of Louis XVI., and he
distinguished himself now by his hostility to the king. A visit
to Flanders for the sake of his health brought him into close
intercourse and sympathy with Dumouriez. In September 1792
Couthon was elected member of the National Convention, and
at the trial of the king voted for the sentence of death without
appeal. He hesitated for a time as to which party he should
join, but finally decided for that of Robespierre, with whom he
had many opinions in common, especially in matters of religion.
He was the first to demand the arrest of the proscribed Girondists.
On the 30th of May 1793 he became a member of the Committee of
Public Safety, and in August was sent as one of the commissioners
of the Convention attached to the army before Lyons. Impatient
at the slow progress made by the besieging force, he decreed
a <i>levée en masse</i> in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, collected
an army of 60,000 men, and himself led them to Lyons. When
the city was taken, on the 9th of October 1793, although the
Convention ordered its destruction, Couthon did not carry out
the decree, and showed moderation in the punishment of the
rebels. The Republican atrocities began only after Couthon
was replaced, on the 3rd of November 1793, by Collot d&rsquo;Herbois.
Couthon returned to Paris, and on the 21st of December was
elected president of the Convention. He contributed to the
prosecution of the Hébertists, and was responsible for the law
of the 22nd Prairial, which in the case of trials before the Revolutionary
Tribunal deprived the accused of the aid of counsel or
of witnesses or their defence, on the pretext of shortening the
proceedings. During the crisis preceding the 9th Thermidor,
Couthon showed considerable courage, giving up a journey to
Auvergne in order, as he wrote, that he might either die or
triumph with Robespierre and liberty. Arrested with Robespierre
and Saint-Just, his colleagues in the triumvirate of the
Terror, and subjected to indescribable sufferings and insults,
he was taken to the scaffold on the same cart with Robespierre
on the 28th of July 1794 (10th Thermidor).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUTTS, THOMAS<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1735-1822), English banker and founder of
the banking house of Coutts &amp; Co., was born on the 7th of
September 1735. He was the fourth son of John Coutts (1699-1751),
who carried on business in Edinburgh as a corn factor and
negotiator of bills of exchange, and who in 1742 was elected lord
provost of the city. The family was originally of Montrose, but
one of its members had settled at Edinburgh about 1696. Soon
after the death of John Coutts the business was divided into two
branches, one carried on in Edinburgh, the other in London.
The banking business in London was in the hands of James and
Thomas Coutts, sons of John Coutts. From the death of his
brother in 1778, Thomas, as surviving partner, became sole head
of the firm; and under his direction the banking house rose
to the highest distinction. His ambition was to establish his
character as a man of business and to make a fortune; and he
lived to succeed in this aim and long to enjoy his reputation and
wealth. A gentleman in manners, hospitable and benevolent, he
counted amongst his friends some of the literary men and the
best actors of his day. Of the enormous wealth which came into
his hands he made munificent use. His private life was not
without its romantic elements. Soon after his settlement in
London he married Elizabeth Starkey, a young woman of humble
origin, who was in attendance on the daughter of his brother
James. They lived happily together, and had three daughters&mdash;Susan,
married in 1796 to the 3rd earl of Guilford; Frances,
married in 1800 to John, 1st marquess of Bute; and Sophia,
married in 1793 to Sir Francis Burdett. Mrs Coutts dying in
1815, her husband soon after married the popular actress,
Harriet Mellon; and to her he left the whole of his immense
fortune. He died in London on the 24th of February 1822.
His widow married in 1827 the 9th duke of St Albans, and died
ten years later, having bequeathed her property to Angela,
youngest daughter of Sir Francis Burdett, who then assumed the
additional name and arms of Coutts. In 1871 this lady was
created Baroness Burdett-Coutts (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COUTURE, THOMAS<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1815-1879), French painter, was born
at Senlis (Oise), and studied under Baron A. J. Gros and Paul
Delaroche, winning a Prix de Rome in 1837. He began exhibiting
historical and <i>genre</i> pictures at the Salon in 1840, and obtained
several medals. His masterpiece was his &ldquo;Romans in the
Decadence of the Empire&rdquo; (1847), now in the Luxembourg;
and his &ldquo;Love of Money&rdquo; (1844; at Toulouse), &ldquo;Falconer&rdquo;
(1855), and &ldquo;Damocles&rdquo; (1872), are also good examples.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COUVADE<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (literally a &ldquo;brooding,&rdquo; from Fr. <i>couver</i>, to hatch,
Lat. <i>cubare</i>, to lie down), a custom so called in Béarn, prevalent
among several peoples in different parts of the world, requiring
that the father, at and sometimes before the birth of his child,
shall retire to bed and fast or abstain from certain kinds of food,
receiving the attentions generally shown to women at their
confinements. The existence of the custom in ancient classical
times is testified to by Apollonius Rhodius, Diodorus (who refers
to its existence among the Corsicans), and Strabo (who noticed it
among the Spanish Basques, by whom, as well as by the Gascons,
it has been said to be still observed, though the most recent
researches entirely discredit this). Travellers, from the time of
Marco Polo, who relates its observance in Chinese Turkestan,
have found the custom to prevail in China, India, Borneo, Siam,
Africa and the Americas. Even in Europe it cannot be said to
have entirely disappeared. In certain of the Baltic provinces of
Russia the husband, on the lying-in of the wife, takes to his bed
and groans in mock pain. One writer believes he found traces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
it in the little island of Marken in the Zuyder Zee. Even in rural
England, notably in East Anglia, a curiously obstinate belief
survives (the prevalence of which in earlier times is proved by
references to it in Elizabethan drama) that the pregnancy of the
woman affects the man, and the young husband who complains
of a toothache is assailed by pleasantries as to his wife&rsquo;s condition.
In Guiana the custom is observed in its most typical form. The
woman works to within a few hours of the birth, but some days
before her delivery the father leaves his occupations and abstains
from certain kinds of animal food lest the child should suffer.
Thus the flesh of the agouti is forbidden, lest the child should be
lean, and that of the capibara or water-cavy, for fear he should
inherit through his father&rsquo;s gluttony that creature&rsquo;s projecting
teeth. A few hours before delivery the woman goes alone, or
with one or two women-friends, into the forest, where the baby is
born. She returns as soon as she can stand, to her work, and the
man then takes to his hammock and becomes the invalid. He
must do no work, must touch no weapons, is forbidden all meat
and food, except at first a fermented liquor and after the twelfth
day a weak gruel of <i>cassava</i> meal. He must not even smoke, or
wash himself, but is waited on hand and foot by the women.
So far is the comedy carried that he whines and groans as if in
actual pain. Six weeks after the birth of the child he is taken in
hand by his relatives, who lacerate his skin and rub him with a
decoction of the pepper-plant. A banquet is then held from
which the patient is excluded, for he must not leave his bed till
several days later; and for six months he must eat the flesh
of neither fish nor bird. Almost identical ceremonies have been
noticed among the natives of California and New Mexico; while
in Greenland and Kamchatka the husband may not work for
some time before and after his wife&rsquo;s confinement. Among the
Larkas of Bengal a period of isolation and uncleanness, synchronous
with that compulsory on the woman, is imperative for
the man, on the conclusion of which the child&rsquo;s parentage is
publicly proclaimed.</p>

<p>No certain explanation can be offered for the custom. The
most reasonable view is that adopted by E. B. Tylor, who traces
in it the transition from the earlier matriarchal to the later
patriarchal system of tribe-organization. Among primitive
tribes, and probably in all ages, the former order of society, in
which descent and inheritance are reckoned through the mother
alone, as being the earliest form of family life, is and was very
common, if not universal. The acknowledgment of a relationship
between father and son is characteristic of the progress of
society towards a true family life. It may well be that the
Couvade arose in the father&rsquo;s desire to emphasize the bond of
blood between himself and his child. It is a fact that in some
countries the father has to purchase the child from its mother;
and in the Roman ceremony of the husband raising the baby from
the floor we may trace the savage idea that the male parent must
formally proclaim his adoption of and responsibility for the
offspring. Max Müller, in his <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>,
endeavoured to find an explanation in primitive &ldquo;henpecking,&rdquo;
asserting that the unfortunate husband was tyrannized over by
&ldquo;his female relatives and afterwards frightened into superstition,&rdquo;&mdash;that,
in fact, the whole fabric of ceremony is reared on nothing
but masculine hysteria; but this theory can scarcely be taken
seriously. The missionary, Joseph François Lafitau, suspected a
psychological reason, assuming the custom to be a dim recollection
of original sin, the isolation and fast types of repentance.
The explanation of the American Indians is that if the father
engaged in any hard or hazardous work, <i>e.g.</i> hunting, or was
careless in his diet, the child would suffer and inherit the physical
faults and peculiarities of the animals eaten. This belief that a
person becomes possessed of the nature and form of the animal he
eats is widespread, being as prevalent in the Old World as in the
New, but it is insufficient to account for the minute ceremonial
details of La Couvade as practised in many lands. It is far more
likely that so universal a practice has no trivial beginnings, but is
to be considered as a mile-stone marking a great transitional
epoch in human progress.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVE,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> a word mostly used in the sense of a small inlet or
sheltered bay in a coast-line. In English dialect usage it is also
applied to a cave or to a recess in a mountain-side. The word
in O. Eng. is <i>cofa</i>, and cognate forms are found in the Ger.
<i>Koben</i>, Norwegian <i>kove</i>, and in various forms in other Teutonic
languages. It has no connexion with &ldquo;alcove,&rdquo; recess in a room
or building, which is derived through the Span. <i>alcoba</i> from Arab.
<i>al</i>, the, and <i>qubbah</i>, vault, arch, nor with &ldquo;cup&rdquo; or &ldquo;coop,&rdquo;
nor with &ldquo;cave&rdquo; (Lat. <i>cava</i>). The use of the word was first
confined to a small chamber or cell or inner recess in a room or
building. From this has come the particular application in
architecture to any kind of concave moulding, the term being
usually applied to the quadrantal curve rising from the cornice
of a lofty room to the moulded borders of the horizontal ceiling.
The term &ldquo;coving&rdquo; is given in half-timbered work to the curved
soffit under a projecting window, or in the 18th century to that
occasionally found carrying the gutter of a house. In the Musée
Plantin at Antwerp the hearth of the fireplace of the upper
floor is carved on coving, which forms part of the design of the
chimney-piece in the room below. The slang use of &ldquo;cove&rdquo;
for any male person, like a &ldquo;fellow,&rdquo; &ldquo;chap,&rdquo; &amp;c., is found in
the form &ldquo;cofe&rdquo; in T. Harman&rsquo;s <i>Caveat for Cursetors</i> (1587)
and other early quotations. This seems to be identical with the
Scots word &ldquo;cofe,&rdquo; a pedlar, hawker, which is formed from
&ldquo;coff,&rdquo; to sell, purchase, cognate with the Ger. <i>kaufen</i>, to
buy, and the native English &ldquo;cheap.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;cove,&rdquo;
therefore, is in ultimate origin the same as &ldquo;chap,&rdquo; short for
&ldquo;chapman,&rdquo; a pedlar.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVELLITE,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a mineral species consisting of cupric sulphide,
CuS, crystallizing in the hexagonal system. It is of less frequent
occurrence in nature than copper-glance, the orthorhombic
cuprous sulphide. Crystals are very rare, the mineral being
usually found as compact and earthy masses or as a blue coating
on other copper sulphides. Hardness 1½-2; specific gravity 4.6.
The dark indigo-blue colour is a characteristic feature, and the
mineral was early known as indigo-copper (Ger. <i>Kupferindig</i>).
The name covellite is taken from N. Covelli, who in 1839 observed
crystals of cupric sulphide encrusting Vesuvian lava, the mineral
having been formed here by the interaction of hydrogen sulphide
and cupric chloride, both of which are volatile volcanic products.
Covellite is, however, more commonly found in copper-bearing
veins, where it has resulted by the alteration of other copper
sulphides, namely chalcopyrite, copper-glance and erubescite.
It is found in many copper mines; localities which may be
specially mentioned are Sangerhausen in Prussian Saxony,
Butte in Montana, and Chile; in the Medicine Bow Mountains
of Wyoming a platiniferous covellite is mined, the platinum
being present as sperrylite (platinum arsenide).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVENANT<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (an O. Fr. form, later <i>convenant</i>, from <i>convenir</i>,
to agree, Lat. <i>convenire</i>), a mutual agreement of two or more
parties, or an undertaking made by one of the parties. In the
Bible the Hebrew word &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1489;, <i>b&#277;r&#299;th</i>, is used widely for many
kinds of agreements; it is then applied to a contract between
two persons or to a treaty between two nations, such as the
covenant made between Abimelech and Isaac, representing a
treaty between the Israelites and the Philistines (Gen. xxvi.
26, seq.); more particularly to an engagement made between
God and men, or such agreements as, by the observance of a
religious rite, regarded God as a party to the engagement. Two
suggestions have been made for the derivation of <i>b&#277;r&#299;th</i>: (1)
tracing the word from a root &ldquo;to cut,&rdquo; and the reference is to
the primitive rite of cutting victims into parts, between which
the parties to an agreement passed, cf. the Greek <span class="grk" title="horkia temnein">&#8005;&#961;&#954;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,
and the account (Gen. xv. 17) of the covenant between God and
Abraham, where &ldquo;a smoking furnace and burning lamp passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
between the pieces&rdquo; of the victims Abraham had sacrificed;
(2) connecting it with an Assyrio-Babylonian <i>biritu</i>, fetter,
alliance. <i>B&#277;r&#299;th</i> was translated in the Septuagint by <span class="grk" title="diathêkê">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951;</span>,
which in classical Greek had the meaning of &ldquo;will&rdquo;; hence
the Vulgate, in the Psalms and the New Testament, translates
the word by <i>testamentum</i>, but elsewhere in the Old Testament
by <i>foedus</i> or <i>pactum</i>; similarly Wycliffe&rsquo;s version gives &ldquo;testament&rdquo;
and &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; respectively. The books of Scripture
dealing with the old or Mosaic, and new or Christian dispensation
are sometimes known as the Books of the Old and the New
Covenant. The word appears in the system of theology developed
by Johannes Cocceius (<i>q.v.</i>), and known as the &ldquo;Covenant&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; Theology, based on the two Covenants of Works
or Life made by God with Adam, on condition of obedience,
and of grace or redemption, made with Christ. In Scottish
ecclesiastical history, covenant appears in the two agreements
signed by the members of the Scottish Church in defence of
their religious and ecclesiastical systems (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Covenanters</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVENANT,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> in law, is the English equivalent of the Lat.
<i>conventio</i>, which, although not technical, was the most general
word in Roman law for &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo; It was frequently used
along with <i>pactum</i>, also a general term, but applied especially
to agreements to settle a question without carrying it before the
courts of law.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; has been used in a variety of senses
in English law.</p>

<p>1. In its strict sense, covenant means an agreement <i>under
seal</i>, that something has or has not already been done, or shall
or shall not be done hereafter (Shep. <i>Touchstone</i>, 160, 162). It
is most commonly used with reference to sales or leases of land,
but is sometimes applied to any promise or stipulation, whether
under seal or not. The person who makes, and is bound to
perform, the promise or stipulation is the covenantor: the
person in whose favour it is made is the covenantee.</p>

<p>2. Covenants have been subdivided into numerous classes,
only a few of which need to be described. It is unnecessary
to do more than mention affirmative and negative covenants,
joint or several, alternative or disjunctive covenants, dependent
or independent covenants. As to collateral covenants, covenants
&ldquo;running with the land,&rdquo; and covenants in leases (including
&ldquo;usual,&rdquo; &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; covenants), see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Landlord
and Tenant</a></span>. But there are other classes as to which
something must be said.</p>

<p>A covenant is said to be <i>express</i> when it is created by the
express words of the parties to the deed declaratory of their
intention. It is not indispensable that the word &ldquo;covenant&rdquo;
should be used. Any word which clearly indicates the intention
of the parties to covenant will suffice. An <i>implied</i> covenant,
or <i>covenant in law</i>, &ldquo;depends for its existence on the intendment
and construction of law. There are some words which of themselves
do not import an express covenant, yet, being made use of
in certain contracts, have a similar operation and are called
covenants in law; and they are as effectually binding on the
parties as if expressed in the most unequivocal terms&rdquo; (Platt on
<i>Covenants</i>, p. 40). Thus, the word &ldquo;demise,&rdquo; used in a lease
of deed, raises the implication of a covenant both for &ldquo;quiet
enjoyment&rdquo; and for title to let; and it has been judicially
suggested that a covenant for quiet enjoyment may be implied
from any word or words of like import (<i>Budd-Scott</i> v. <i>Daniell</i>,
1902, 2 K.B. p. 359). The Conveyancing Act 1881 provides
(§ 7) that in a conveyance for valuable consideration, other
than a mortgage, there shall be implied, as against the person
who conveys and is expressed to convey as &ldquo;beneficial owner,&rdquo;
certain <i>qualified</i> covenants&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> covenants extending only to
the acts or omissions of the vendor, persons through whom he
derives title otherwise than by purchase for value, and persons
claiming under them&mdash;for &ldquo;right to convey,&rdquo; &ldquo;quiet enjoyment,&rdquo;
&ldquo;freedom from incumbrances&rdquo; and &ldquo;further assurance.&rdquo; Of
these statutory covenants for title the only one which requires
explanation is the covenant for further assurance. It imports
an agreement on the part of the covenantor to do such reasonable
acts, in addition to those already performed, as may be necessary
for the completion of the transfer made (or intended to be made)
at the requirements of the covenantee (Platt on <i>Covenants</i>, p. 341).
All these statutory implied covenants &ldquo;run with the land&rdquo;
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Landlord and Tenant</a></span>). Where a mortgagor conveys,
and is expressed to convey, as &ldquo;beneficial owner,&rdquo; there are
implied <i>absolute</i> covenants&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> covenants amounting to a
warranty against and for the acts and omissions of the whole
world&mdash;that he has a right to convey, that the mortgagee shall
have quiet enjoyment of the property after default, free from
incumbrances and for further assurance. Special provisions as
to implied covenants by the lessor in leases are made in England
by § 7 (B) of the Conveyancing Act 1881 and in Ireland by the
Land Act (Ireland) 1860, § 41. The distinction between <i>real</i>
and <i>personal</i> covenants is that the former do, while the latter
do not, run with the land. An <i>inherent</i> covenant is another
name for a <i>real</i> covenant (Shep. <i>Touchstone</i>, 176; Platt, 60).
When a covenant relates to an act already done, it is usually
termed a covenant <i>executed</i>; where the performance is future,
the covenant is termed <i>executory</i>. The <i>covenant for seisin</i> was
an assurance to the grantee that the grantor had the estate
which he purported to convey. In England it is now included
in the covenant for right to convey; but is still in separate use
in several states in America. The <i>covenant to stand seised to
uses</i> was an assurance by means of which, under the Statute of
Uses [1536] (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Uses</a></span>), a conveyance of an estate might be
effected. When such a covenant is made, the legal estate in the
land passes at once to the covenantee under the statute. The
consideration for the covenant must be relationship by blood or
marriage. It is still occasionally though very rarely employed.
The <i>covenant not</i> to <i>sue</i> belongs to the law of contract and needs
no <span class="correction" title="amended from explantion">explanation</span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of the classes of covenants above mentioned are in use in
the United States. In New York, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon,
Wisconsin and Wyoming the implication of covenants for title has
been, with certain exceptions, prohibited by statute. In Alabama,
Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Texas the words <i>grant</i>, <i>bargain</i>
and <i>sell</i>, in conveyances in fee, unless specially restricted, amount
to qualified covenants that the grantor was seised in fee, free from
incumbrances, and for quiet enjoyment (4 Kent, <i>Commentaries</i>, § 473;
Bouvier, <i>Law Dictionary</i>, s.v. Covenant). In some of the states
a <i>covenant of non-claim</i>, or of <i>warranty</i>, an assurance by the grantor
that neither he nor his heirs, nor any other person shall claim any
title in the premises conveyed, is in general use.</p>

<p>3. An <i>action of covenant</i> lay for breaking covenant. As to the
history of this action see Pollock and Maitland, <i>History of
English Law</i>, ii. 106; and Holmes, <i>The Common Law</i>, p. 272.
There was also a <i>writ of covenant</i>. But this remedy had fallen
into disuse before 1830 (see Platt on <i>Covenants</i>, p. 543), and was
abolished by the Common Law Procedure Acts. Since the
Judicature Acts, an action on a covenant follows the same
course as, and is indistinguishable from, any ordinary action
for breach of contract. The remedy is by damages, decree of
specific performance or injunction to prevent the breach.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The term &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; is unknown to Scots law. But its place is
filled to some extent by the doctrine of &ldquo;warrandice.&rdquo; Many of the
British colonies have legislated, as to the implication of covenants
for title, on the lines of the English Conveyancing Act 1881; <i>e.g.</i>
Tasmania, Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1884 (47 Vict.

<p><span class="bold">COVENANTERS,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> the name given to a party which, originating
in the Reformation movement, played an important part in the
history of Scotland, and to a lesser extent in that of England,
during the 17th century. The Covenanters were thus named
because in a series of <i>bands</i> or <i>covenants</i> they bound themselves
to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole
religion of their country. The first &ldquo;godly band&rdquo; is dated
December 1557; but more important is the covenant of 1581,
drawn up by John Craig in consequence of the strenuous efforts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
which the Roman Catholics were making to regain their hold
upon Scotland, and called the King&rsquo;s Confession or National
Covenant. Based upon the Confession of Faith of 1560, this
document denounced the pope and the doctrines of the Roman
Catholic Church in no measured terms. It was adopted by the
General Assembly, signed by King James VI. and his household,
and enjoined on persons of all ranks and classes; and was again
subscribed in 1590 and 1596. In 1637 Scotland was in a state of
turmoil. Charles I. and Archbishop Laud had just met with a
reverse in their efforts to impose the English liturgy upon the
Scots; and fearing further measures on the part of the king,
it occurred to Archibald Johnston, Lord Warriston, to revive
the National Covenant of 1581. Additional matter intended
to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time
was added, and the covenant was adopted and signed by a large
gathering in Greyfriars&rsquo; churchyard, Edinburgh, on the 28th
of February 1638, after which copies were sent throughout the
country for additional signatures. The subscribers engaged by
oath to maintain religion in the state in which it existed in 1580,
and to reject all innovations introduced since that time, while
professed expressions of loyalty to the king were added. The
General Assembly of 1638 was composed of ardent Covenanters,
and in 1640 the covenant was adopted by the parliament, and
its subscription was required from all citizens. Before this date
the Covenanters were usually referred to as <i>Supplicants</i>, but from
about this time the former designation began to prevail.</p>

<p>A further development took place in 1643. The leaders of
the English parliament, worsted in the Civil War, implored the
aid of the Scots, which was promised on condition that the
Scottish system of church government was adopted in England.
After some haggling a document called the Solemn League and
Covenant was drawn up. This was practically a treaty between
England and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed
religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and
Ireland &ldquo;according to the word of God and the example of the
best reformed churches,&rdquo; and the extirpation of popery and
prelacy. It was subscribed by many in both kingdoms and also
in Ireland, and was approved by the English parliament, and
with some slight modifications by the Westminster Assembly of
Divines. Charles I. refused to accept it when he surrendered
himself to the Scots in 1646, but he made important concessions
in this direction in the &ldquo;Engagement&rdquo; made with the Scots in
December 1647. Charles II. before landing in Scotland in June
1650 declared by a solemn oath his approbation of both covenants,
and this was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone
in the following January.</p>

<p>From 1638 to 1651 the Covenanters were the dominant party
in Scotland, directing her policy both at home and abroad.
Their power, however, which had been seriously weakened by
Cromwell&rsquo;s victory at Dunbar in September 1651, was practically
destroyed when Charles II. was restored nine years later. Firmly
seated upon the throne Charles renounced the covenants, which
in 1662 were declared unlawful oaths, and were to be abjured
by all persons holding public offices. Episcopacy was restored,
the court of high commission was revived, and ministers who
refused to recognize the authority of the bishops were expelled
from their livings. Gathering around them many of the
Covenanters who clung tenaciously to their standards of faith,
these ministers began to preach in the fields, and a period of
persecution marked by savage hatred and great brutality
began. Further oppressive measures were directed against the
Covenanters, who took up arms about 1665, and the struggle
soon assumed the proportions of a rebellion. The forces of the
crown under John Graham of Claverhouse and others were sent
against them, and although the insurgents gained isolated
successes, in general they were worsted and were treated with
great barbarity. They maintained, however, their cherished
covenants with a zeal which persecution only intensified; in
1680 the more extreme members of the party signed a document
known as the &ldquo;Sanquhar Declaration,&rdquo; and were afterwards
called Cameronians from the name of their leader, Richard
Cameron (<i>q.v.</i>). They renounced their allegiance to King James
and were greatly disappointed when their standards found no
place in the religious settlement of 1689, continuing to hold the
belief that the covenants should be made obligatory upon the
entire nation. The Covenanters had a martyrology of their own,
and the halo of romance has been cast around their exploits and
their sufferings. Their story, however, especially during the
time of their political predominance, is part of the general history
of Scotland (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVENT GARDEN,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> formerly an open space north of the
Strand, London, England, now occupied by the principal flower,
fruit and vegetable market in the metropolis. This was originally
the so-called &ldquo;convent garden&rdquo; belonging to the abbey of St
Peter, Westminster. In the first half of the 17th century the
site of the garden was laid out as a square by Inigo Jones, with a
piazza on two sides; and as early as 1656 it was becoming a
market place for the same commodities as are now sold in it.
Covent Garden Theatre (1858) is the chief seat of grand opera
in London. The site has carried a theatre since 1733, but earlier
buildings were burnt in 1809 and 1856.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVENTRY, SIR JOHN<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (d. 1682), son of John Coventry, the
second son of Thomas, Lord Keeper Coventry, was returned to
the Long Parliament in 1640 as member for Evesham. During
the Civil War he served for the king, and at the Restoration was
created a knight. In 1667, and in the following parliaments of
1678, 1679 and 1681, he was elected for Weymouth, and opposed
the government. On the 21st of December 1670, owing to a jest
made by Coventry in the House of Commons on the subject of
the king&rsquo;s amours, Sir Thomas Sandys, an officer of the guards,
with other accomplices, by the order of Monmouth, and (it was
said) with the approval of the king himself, waylaid him as he
was returning home to Suffolk Street and slit his nose to the bone.
The outrage created an extraordinary sensation, and in consequence
a measure known as the &ldquo;Coventry Act&rdquo; was passed,
declaring assaults accompanied by personal mutilation a felony
without benefit of clergy. Sir John died in 1682. Sir William
Coventry, his uncle, speaks slightingly of him, ridicules his
vanity and wishes him out of the House of Commons to be &ldquo;out
of harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVENTRY, THOMAS COVENTRY,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1578-1640),
lord keeper of England, eldest son of Sir Thomas Coventry,
judge of the common pleas (a descendant of John Coventry,
lord mayor of London in the reign of Henry VI.), and of Margaret
Jeffreys of Earls Croome, or Croome D&rsquo;Abitot, in Worcestershire,
was born in 1578. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1592,
and the Inner Temple in 1594, becoming bencher of the society
in 1614, reader in 1616, and holding the office of treasurer from
1617 till 1621. His exceptional legal abilities were rewarded
early with official promotion. On the 16th of November 1616 he
was made recorder of London in spite of Bacon&rsquo;s opposition, who,
although allowing him to be &ldquo;a well trained and an honest man,&rdquo;
objected that he was &ldquo;bred by my Lord Coke and seasoned in
his ways.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1f" id="FnAnchor_1f" href="#Footnote_1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> On the 14th of March 1617 he was appointed
solicitor-general and was knighted; was returned for Droitwich
to the parliament of 1621; and on the 11th of January in that
year was made attorney-general. He took part in the proceedings
against Bacon for corruption, and was manager for the Commons
in the impeachment of Edward Floyd for insulting the elector
and electress palatine.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November 1625 he was made lord keeper of the
great seal; in this capacity he delivered the king&rsquo;s reprimand to
the Commons on the 29th of March 1626, when he declared that
&ldquo;liberty of counsel&rdquo; alone belonged to them and not &ldquo;liberty of
control.&rdquo; On the 10th of April 1628 he received the title of
Baron Coventry of Aylesborough in Worcestershire. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
opening of parliament in 1628 he threatened that the king
would use his prerogative if further thwarted in the matter of
supplies. In the subsequent debates, however, while strongly
supporting the king&rsquo;s prerogative against the claims of the
parliament to executive power, he favoured a policy of moderation
and compromise. He defended the right of the council to
commit to prison without showing cause, and to issue &ldquo;general&rdquo;
warrants; though he allowed it should only be employed in
special circumstances, disapproved of the king&rsquo;s sudden dissolution
of parliament, and agreed to the liberation on bail of the
seven imprisoned members on condition of their giving security
for their good behaviour. He showed less subservience than
Bacon to Buckingham, and his resistance to the latter&rsquo;s pretensions
to the office of lord high constable greatly incensed the duke.
Buckingham taunted Coventry with having gained his place by
his favour; to which the lord keeper replied, &ldquo;Did I conceive I
had my place by your favour, I would presently unmake myself
by returning the seal to his Majesty.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2f" id="FnAnchor_2f" href="#Footnote_2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> After this defiance
Buckingham&rsquo;s sudden death alone probably prevented Coventry&rsquo;s
displacement. He passed sentence of death on Lord Audley in
1631, drafted and enforced the proclamation of the 20th of June
1632 ordering the country gentlemen to leave London, and in
1634 joined in Laud&rsquo;s attack on the earl of Portland for peculation.
The same year, in an address to the judges, he supported
the proposed levy of ship-money on the inland as well as the
maritime counties on the plea of the necessity of effectually
arming, &ldquo;so that they might not be enforced to fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
wooden walls&rdquo; being in his opinion &ldquo;the best walls of this
kingdom.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_3f" id="FnAnchor_3f" href="#Footnote_3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In the Star Chamber Coventry was one of Lilburne&rsquo;s
judges in 1637, but he generally showed conspicuous moderation,
inclining to leniency in the cases of Richard Chambers in 1629 for
seditious speeches, and of Henry Sherfield in 1632 for breaking
painted glass in a church. He prevented also the hanging of men
for resistance to impressment, and pointed out its illegality, since
the men were not subject to martial law. While contributing
thirty horse to the Scottish expedition in 1638, and lending the
king £10,000 in 1639, he gave no support to the forced loan
levied upon the city in the latter year. He died on the 14th of
January 1640.</p>

<p>Lord Coventry held the great seal for nearly fifteen years, and
was enabled to collect a large fortune. He was an able judge, and
he issued some important orders in chancery, probably alluded to
by Wood, who ascribes to him a tract on &ldquo;The Fees of all law
Officers.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4f" id="FnAnchor_4f" href="#Footnote_4f"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Whitelocke accuses him of mediocrity,<a name="FnAnchor_5f" id="FnAnchor_5f" href="#Footnote_5f"><span class="sp">5</span></a> but his
contemporaries in general have united in extolling his judicial
ability, his quick despatch of business and his sound and sterling
character. Clarendon in particular praises his statesmanship,
and compares his capacity with Lord Strafford&rsquo;s, adding,
however, that he seldom spoke in the council except on legal
business and had little influence in political affairs; to the latter
circumstance he owed his exceptional popularity. He describes
him as having &ldquo;in the plain way of speaking and delivery a
strange power of making himself believed,&rdquo; as a man of &ldquo;not
only firm gravity but a severity and even some morosity,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;rather exceedingly liked than passionately loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Coventry married (1) Sarah, daughter of Sir Edward
Sebright of Besford in Worcestershire, by whom besides a
daughter he had one son, Thomas, who succeeded him as 2nd
baron, and (2) Elizabeth, daughter of John Aldersley of Spurstow,
Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford, by whom he had four
sons, John, Francis, Henry and Sir William Coventry, the
statesman.</p>

<p>Thomas Coventry, 5th baron (d. 1699), was created an earl in
1697 with a special limitation, on failure of his own male issue,
to that of Walter, youngest brother of the lord keeper, from
whom the present earl of Coventry is descended.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVENTRY, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (c. 1628-1686), English statesman,
son of the lord keeper, Thomas, Lord Coventry, by his second
wife Elizabeth Aldersley, was born about 1628. He matriculated
at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, at the age of fourteen. Owing to the
outbreak of the Civil War he was obliged to quit his studies, but
according to Sir John Bramston &ldquo;he had a good tutor who made
him a scholar, and he travelled and got the French language in
good perfection.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was young whilst the war continued,&rdquo;
wrote Clarendon, &ldquo;yet he had put himself before the end of it
into the army and had the command of a foot company and
shortly after travelled into France.&rdquo; Here he remained till all
hopes of obtaining foreign assistance and of raising a new army
had to be laid aside, when he returned to England and kept
aloof from the various royalist intrigues. When, however, a new
prospect of a restoration appeared in 1660, Coventry hastened to
Breda, was appointed secretary to James, duke of York, lord
high admiral of England, and headed the royal procession when
Charles entered London in triumph.</p>

<p>He was returned to the Restoration parliament of 1661 for
Great Yarmouth, became commissioner for the navy in May 1662
and in 1663 was made D.C.L. at Oxford. His great talents were
very soon recognized in parliament, and his influence as an
official was considerable. His appointment was rather that of
secretary to the admiralty than of personal assistant to the duke
of York,<a name="FnAnchor_1g" id="FnAnchor_1g" href="#Footnote_1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and was one of large gains. Wood states that he
collected a fortune of £60,000. Accusations of corruption in his
naval administration, and especially during the Dutch war, were
brought against him, but there is nothing to show that he ever
transgressed the limits sanctioned by usage and custom in
obtaining his emoluments. Pepys in his diary invariably testifies
to the excellence of his administration and to his zeal for reform
and economy. His ability and energy, however, did little to
avert the naval collapse, owing chiefly to financial mismanagement
and to the ill-advised appointments to command. Coventry
denied all responsibility for the Dutch War in 1665, which
Clarendon sought to place upon his shoulders, and his repudiation
is supported by Pepys; it was, moreover, contrary to his well-known
political opinion. The war greatly increased his influence,
and shortly after the victory off Lowestoft, on the 3rd of June
1665, he was knighted and made a privy councillor (26th of June)
and was subsequently admitted to the committee on foreign
affairs. In 1667 he was appointed to the board of treasury to
effect financial reforms. &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; writes Pepys on the 23rd
of August 1667, &ldquo;Sir William Coventry is the man and nothing
done till he comes,&rdquo; and on his removal in 1669 the duke of
Albemarle, no friendly or partial critic, declares that &ldquo;nothing
now would be well done.&rdquo; His appointment, however, came too
late to ward off the naval disaster at Chatham the same year and
the national bankruptcy in 1672.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Coventry&rsquo;s rising influence had been from the first
the cause of increasing jealousy to the old chancellor Clarendon,
who especially disliked and discouraged the younger generation.
Coventry resented this repression and thought ill of the conduct
of the administration. He became the chief mover in the successful
attack made upon Clarendon, but refused to take any part in
his impeachment. Two days after Clarendon&rsquo;s resignation (on
the 31st of August), Coventry announced his intention of leaving
the duke&rsquo;s service and of terminating his connexion with the
navy.<a name="FnAnchor_2g" id="FnAnchor_2g" href="#Footnote_2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> As the principal agent in effecting Clarendon&rsquo;s fall he
naturally acquired new power and influence, and the general
opinion pointed to him as his successor as first minister of the
crown. Personal merit, patriotism and conspicuous ability,
however, were poor passports to place and power in Charles II.&rsquo;s
reign. Coventry retained merely his appointment at the
treasury, and the brilliant but unscrupulous and incapable duke
of Buckingham, a favourite of the king, succeeded to Lord
Clarendon. The relations between the two men soon became
unfriendly. Buckingham ridiculed Sir William&rsquo;s steady attention
to business, and was annoyed at his opposition to Clarendon&rsquo;s
impeachment. Coventry rapidly lost influence, was excluded
from the cabinet council, and six months after Clarendon&rsquo;s fall
complains he has scarcely a friend at court. Finally, in March
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
1669, Buckingham having written a play in which Sir William
was ridiculed, the latter sent him a challenge. Notice of the
challenge reached the authorities through the duke&rsquo;s second,
and Sir William was imprisoned in the Tower on the 3rd of March
and subsequently expelled from the privy council. He was
superseded in the treasury on the 11th of March by Buckingham&rsquo;s
favourite, Sir Thomas Osborne, afterwards earl of Danby and
duke of Leeds, and was at last released from the Tower on the
21st in disgrace. The real cause of his dismissal was clearly the
final adoption by Charles of the policy of subservience to France
and desertion of Holland and Protestant interests. Six weeks
before Coventry&rsquo;s fall, the conference between Charles, James,
Arlington, Clifford and Arundel had taken place, which resulted
a year and a half later in the disgraceful treaty of Dover. To
such schemes Sir William, with his steady hostility to France
and active devotion to Protestantism, was doubtless a formidable
opponent. He now withdrew definitely from official life, still
retaining, however, his ascendancy in the House of Commons, and
leading the party which condemned and criticized the reactionary
and fatal policy of the government, his credit and reputation
being rather enhanced than diminished by his dismissal.<a name="FnAnchor_3g" id="FnAnchor_3g" href="#Footnote_3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>In 1673 was published a pamphlet which went through five
editions the same year, entitled <i>England&rsquo;s appeal from the
Private Cabal at Whitehall to the Great Council of the Nation ...
by a true Lover of his Country</i>, an anonymous work universally
ascribed to Sir William, which forcibly reflects his opinions on
the French entanglement. In the great matter of the Indulgence,
while refusing to discuss the limits of prerogative and liberty, he
argued that the dispensing power of the crown could not be valid
during the session of parliament, and criticized the manner of
the declaration while approving its ostensible object. He supported
the Test Act, but maintained a statesmanlike moderation
amidst the tide of indignation rising against the government, and
refused to take part in the personal attacks upon ministers,
drawing upon himself the same unpopularity as his nephew
Halifax incurred later. In the same year he warmly denounced
the alliance with France. During the summer of 1674 he was
again received at court. In 1675 he supported the bill to exclude
Roman Catholics from both Houses, and also the measure
to close the House of Commons to placemen; and he showed
great activity in his opposition to the French connexion, especially
stigmatizing the encouragement given by the government to
the levying of troops for the French service. In May 1677 he
voted for the Dutch alliance. Like most of his contemporaries
he accepted the story of the popish plot in 1678. Coventry
several times refused the highest court appointments, and he was
not included in Sir W. Temple&rsquo;s new-modelled council in April
1679. In the exclusion question he favoured at first a policy of
limitations, and on his nephew Halifax, who on his retirement
became the leader of the moderate party, he enjoined prudence
and patience, and greatly regretted the violence of the opposition
which eventually excited a reaction and ruined everything. He
refused to stand for the new parliament, and retired to his country
residence at Minster Lovell near Witney, in Oxfordshire. He
died unmarried on the 23rd of June 1686, at Somerhill near
Tunbridge Wells, where he had gone to take the waters, and
was buried at Penshurst, where a monument was erected to his
memory. In his will he ordered his funeral to be at small expense,
and left £2000 to the French Protestant refugees in England,
besides £3000 for the liberation of captives in Algiers. He had
shortly before his death already paid for the liberation of sixty
slaves. He was much beloved and respected in his family circle,
his nephew, Henry Savile, alluding to him in affectionate terms
as &ldquo;our dearest uncle&rdquo; and &ldquo;incomparable friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Sir William Coventry never filled that place in the
national administration to which his merit and exceptional
ability clearly entitled him, his public life together with his
correspondence are sufficient to distinguish him from amongst
his contemporaries as a statesman of the first rank. Lord
Halifax obviously derived from his honoured mentor those
principles of government which, by means of his own brilliant
intellectual gifts, originality and imaginative insight, gained
further force and influence. Halifax owed to him his interest
in the navy and his grasp of the necessity to a country of a
powerful maritime force. He drew his antagonism to France,
his religious tolerance, wide religious views but firm Protestantism
doubtless from the same source. Sir William was the original
&ldquo;Trimmer.&rdquo; Writing to his nephew Viscount Weymouth,
while denying the authorship of <i>The Character of a Trimmer</i>,
he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I have not been ashamed to own myself to be a
trimmer ... one who would sit upright and not overturn the
boat by swaying too much to either side.&rdquo; He shared the
Trimmer&rsquo;s dislike of party, urging Halifax in the exclusion
contest &ldquo;not to be thrust by the opposition of his enemies into
another party, but that he keep upon a national bottom which
at length will prevail.&rdquo; His prudence is expressed in his
&ldquo;perpetual unwillingness to do things which I cannot undo.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A singular independence of spirit, a breadth of mind which
refused to be contracted by party formulas, a sanity which was
proof against the contagion of national delirium, were equally
characteristic of uncle and nephew.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4g" id="FnAnchor_4g" href="#Footnote_4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Sir William Coventry&rsquo;s
conceptions of statesmanship, under the guiding hand of his
nephew, largely inspired the future revolution settlement, and
continued to be an essential condition of English political
growth and progress.</p>

<p>Besides the tract already mentioned Coventry was the author
of <i>A Letter to Dr Burnet giving an Account of Cardinal Pool&rsquo;s
Secret Powers ...</i> (1685). <i>The Character of a Trimmer</i>, often
ascribed to him, is now known to have been written by Lord
Halifax. &ldquo;Notes concerning the Poor,&rdquo; and an essay &ldquo;concerning
the decay of rents and the remedy,&rdquo; are among the Malet
Papers (<i>Hist. MSS. Comm.</i> Ser. 5th Rep. app. 320 (a)) and
<i>Add. MSS.</i> Brit. Mus. (cal. 1882-1887); an &ldquo;Essay concerning
France&rdquo; (4th Rep. app. 229 (b)) and a &ldquo;Discourse on the Management
of the Navy&rdquo; (230b) are among the MSS. of the marquess
of Bath, also a catalogue of his library (233(a)).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVENTRY,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> a municipal, county and parliamentary borough
of Warwickshire, England; 94 m. N.W. from London by the
London &amp; North Western railway. Pop. (1901) 69,978. The
Coventry canal communicates with the Trent and Mersey and
Birmingham canals, and the midland system generally.
Coventry stands on a gentle eminence, with higher ground lying
to the west, and is watered by the Sherbourne and the Radford
Brook, feeders of the Avon, which unite within the town. Of its
ancient fortifications two gates and some portions of the wall are
still extant, and several of the older streets are picturesque from
the number of half-timbered houses projecting over the footways.</p>

<p>The most remarkable buildings are the churches; of these the
oldest are St Michael&rsquo;s, one of the finest specimens of Perpendicular
architecture in England, with a beautiful steeple rising
to a height of 303 ft.; Holy Trinity church, a cruciform structure
with a lofty steeple at the intersection; and St John&rsquo;s, or
Bablake church, which is nearly a parallelogram on the ground
plan, but cruciform in the clerestory with a central tower.
Christ church dates only from 1832, but it is attached to the
ancient spire of the Grey Friars&rsquo; church. Of secular buildings the
most interesting is St Mary&rsquo;s hall, erected by the united gilds in
the early part of the 15th century. The principal chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
situated above a fine crypt, is 76 ft. long, 30 ft. wide and 34 ft.
high; its roof is of carved oak, and in the north end there is a
large window of old stained glass, with a curious piece of tapestry
beneath nearly as old as the building. In the treasury is preserved
a valuable collection of ancient muniments. A statue of Sir
Thomas White, lord mayor of London (1532-1533), founder of
St John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, was erected in 1883. The cemetery,
laid out by Sir Joseph Paxton, the architect and landscape
gardener, and enlarged in 1887, is particularly beautiful. The
educational institutions include a well-endowed free grammar
school, founded in the reign of Elizabeth, in modern buildings
(1885), a technical school, school of art, endowed charity schools,
and a county reformatory for girls; and among the charitable
foundations, which are numerous and valuable, Bond&rsquo;s hospital
for old men and Ford&rsquo;s hospital for old women are remarkable as
fine specimens of ancient timber work. Swanswell and Spenser
Parks were opened in 1883, and a recreation ground in 1880.</p>

<p>Coventry was formerly noted for its woollens, and subsequently
acquired such a reputation for its dyeing that the expression &ldquo;as
true as Coventry blue&rdquo; became proverbial. Existing industries
are the making of motor cars, cycles and their accessories, for
which Coventry is one of the chief centres in Great Britain;
sewing machines are also produced; and carpet-weaving and
dyeing, art metal working and watch making are carried on.
An ancient fair is held in Whit-week. A county of itself till 1843,
the town became a county borough in 1888. The corporation
consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and 30 councillors. The
parliamentary borough returns one member. In 1894 a suffragan
bishopric of Coventry was established under the see of Worcester,
but no longer exists. Area, 4149 acres.</p>

<p>The village which afterwards became important as Coventry
(<i>Coventreu</i>, <i>Coventre</i>) owed its existence to the foundation of a
Benedictine monastery by Earl Leofric and his wife Godgyfu,
the famous Lady Godiva (<i>q.v.</i>), in 1043. The manor, which in
1066 belonged to the latter, descended to the earls of Chester and
to Robert de Montalt, and from him passed to Isabella queen of
Edward II. and the crown. Ranulf, earl of Chester, granted the
earliest extant charter to the town in 1153, by which his burgesses
were to hold of him in free burgage as they held of his father,
and to have their portmote. This, with further privileges, was
confirmed by Henry II. in 1177, and by nearly every succeeding
sovereign until the 17th century. In 1345 Edward III. gave
Coventry a corporation, mayor and bailiffs empowered to hold
pleas and keep the town prison. Edward the Black Prince
granted the mayor and bailiffs the right to hold the town in fee
farm of £50 and to build a wall. In 1452 Henry VI. formed the
city and surrounding hamlets into a county, and James I.
incorporated Coventry in 1622. It first sent two representatives
to parliament in 1295, but the returns were irregular. The
prior&rsquo;s market on Fridays was probably of Saxon origin; a
second market was granted in 1348, while fairs, still held, were
obtained in 1217 for the octave of Holy Trinity, and in 1348 and in
1442 for eight days from the Friday after Corpus Christi. As
early as 1216 Coventry was important for its trade in wool, cloth
and caps, its gilds later being particularly numerous and wealthy.
In 1568 Flemish weavers introduced new methods, but the trade
was destroyed in the wars of the 17th century. During the
middle of the 16th century there was a flourishing manufacture
of blue thread, but this decayed before 1581; in the 18th
century the manufacture of ribbon was introduced.</p>

<p>The popular phrase &ldquo;to send to Coventry&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> to refuse to
associate with a person) is of uncertain derivation. The <i>New
English Dictionary</i> selects the period of the Civil War of the 17th
century as that in which the origin of the phrase is probably to be
found. Clarendon (<i>History of the Great Rebellion</i>, 1647) states
that the citizens of Birmingham rose against certain small
parties of the king&rsquo;s supporters, and sent the prisoners they
captured to Coventry, which was then strongly parliamentarian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVER<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (from the Fr. <i>couvert</i>, from <i>couvrir</i>, to cover, Lat.
<i>cooperire</i>), that which hides, shuts in or conceals, a lid to a
box or vessel, &amp;c., the binding of a book or wrapper of a parcel;
as a hunting term, the wood or undergrowth which shelters game.
As a commercial term, the word means in its widest sense a
security against loss, but is employed more particularly in
connexion with stock exchange transactions to signify a &ldquo;deposit
made with a broker to secure him from being out of pocket in the
event of the stocks falling against his client and the client not
paying the difference&rdquo; (<i>In re Cronmire</i>, 1898, 2 Q.B. 383). It is a
mode of speculation engaged in almost entirely by persons who
wish to limit their risk to a small amount, and, as a rule, the
transactions are largely carried out in England with &ldquo;outside&rdquo;
brokers, <i>i.e.</i> those dealers in securities who are not members of
the Stock Exchange. The deposit is so much per cent or per
share, usually 1% on the market value of the securities up to
about twice the amount of the turn of the market; the client
being able to close the transaction at any time during the currency
of the cover, but the broker only when the cover is exhausted or
has &ldquo;run off.&rdquo; Cover is not money deposited to abide the event
of a wager, but as security against a debt which may arise from
a gaming contract, and it may be recovered back, if unappropriated.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COVERDALE, MILES<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1488?-1569), English translator of the
Bible and bishop of Exeter, was born of Yorkshire parents about
1488, studied philosophy and theology at Cambridge, was
ordained priest at Norwich in 1514, and then entered the convent
of Austin friars at Cambridge. Here he came under the influence
of the prior, Robert Barnes, made the acquaintance of Sir Thomas
More and of Thomas Cromwell, and began a thorough study of
the Scriptures. He was one of those who met at the White
Horse tavern to discuss theological questions, and when Barnes
was arrested on a charge of heresy, Coverdale went up to London
to assist him in drawing up his defence. Soon afterwards he
left the convent, assumed the habit of a secular priest, and began
to preach against confession and the worship of images. In
1531 he graduated bachelor of canon law at Cambridge, but from
1528 to 1534 he prudently spent most of his time abroad. No
corroboration has, however, been found for Foxe&rsquo;s statement
that in 1529 he was at Hamburg assisting Tyndale in his translation
of the Pentateuch. In 1534 he published two translations of
his own, the first Dulichius&rsquo;s <i>Vom alten und newen Gott</i>, and the
second a <i>Paraphrase upon the Psalms</i>, and in 1535 he completed
his translation of the Bible. The venture seems to have been
projected by Jacob van Meteren, who apparently employed
Coverdale to do the translation, and Froschover of Zürich to
do the printing. No perfect copy is known to exist, and the five
or six which alone have title-pages give no name of publisher
or place of publication. The volume is dedicated to the king of
England, where Convocation at Cranmer&rsquo;s instance had, in
December 1534, petitioned for an authorized English version of
the Scriptures. As a work of scholarship it does not rank
particularly high. Some of the title-pages state that it had been
translated out of &ldquo;Douche&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> German) &ldquo;and Latyn&rdquo;: and
Coverdale mentions that he used five interpreters, which are
supposed to have been the Vulgate, the Latin version of Pagninus,
Luther&rsquo;s translation, the Zürich version, and Tyndale&rsquo;s Pentateuch
and New Testament. There is no definite mention of the
original Greek and Hebrew texts; but it has considerable
literary merit, many of Coverdale&rsquo;s phrases are retained in the
authorized version, and it was the first complete Bible to be
printed in English. Two fresh editions were issued in 1537, but
none of them received official sanction. Coverdale was, however,
employed by Cromwell to assist in the production of the Great
Bible of 1539, which was ordered to be placed in all English
churches. The work was done at Paris until the French government
stopped it, when Coverdale and his colleagues returned
to England early in 1539 to complete it. He was also employed
in the same year in assisting at the suppression of superstitious
usages, but the reaction of 1540 drove him once more abroad.
His Bible was prohibited by proclamation in 1542, while Coverdale
himself defied the Six Articles by marrying Elizabeth Macheson,
sister-in-law to Dr John MacAlpine.</p>

<p>For a time Coverdale lived at Tübingen, where he was created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
D.D. In 1545 he was pastor and schoolmaster at Bergzabern
in the duchy of Pfalz-Zweibrücken. In March 1548 he was at
Frankfort, when the new English Order of Communion reached
him; he at once translated it into German and Latin and sent
a copy to Calvin, whose wife had befriended Coverdale at Strassburg.
Calvin, however, does not seem to have approved of it
so highly as Coverdale.</p>

<p>Coverdale was already on his way back to England, and in
October 1548 he was staying at Windsor Castle, where Cranmer
and some other divines, inaccurately called the Windsor Commission,
were preparing the First Book of Common Prayer. His
first appointment had been as almoner to Queen Catherine Parr,
then wife of Lord Seymour; and he preached her funeral sermon
in September 1548. He was also chaplain to the young king
and took an active part in the reforming measures of his reign.
He was one of the most effective preachers of the time. A sermon
by him at St Paul&rsquo;s on the second Sunday in Lent, 1549, was
immediately followed by the pulling down of &ldquo;the sacrament
at the high altar.&rdquo; A few weeks later he preached at the penance
of some Anabaptists, and in January 1550 he was put on a
commission to prosecute Anabaptists and all who infringed the
Book of Common Prayer. In 1549 he wrote a dedication to
Edward for a translation of the second volume of Erasmus&rsquo;s
<i>Paraphrases</i>; and in 1550 he translated Otto Wermueller&rsquo;s
<i>Precious Pearl</i>, for which Protector Somerset, who had derived
spiritual comfort from the book while in the Tower, wrote a
preface. He was much in request at funerals: he preached
at Sir James Wilford&rsquo;s in November 1550, and at Lord Wentworth&rsquo;s
before a great concourse in Westminster Abbey in
March 1551.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his gift of oratory which suggested his appointment
as bishop of the refractory men of Devon and Cornwall.
He had already, in August 1549, at some risk, gone down with
Lord Russell to turn the hearts of the rebels by preaching and
persuasion, and two years later he was appointed bishop of Exeter
by letters patent, on the compulsory retirement of his predecessor,
Veysey, who had reached an almost mythical age.
He was an active prelate, and perhaps the vigorous Protestantism
of the West in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign was partly due to his persuasive
powers. He sat on the commission for the reform of the canon
law, and was in constant attendance during the parliaments of
1552 and 1553. On Mary&rsquo;s accession he was at once deprived
on the score of his marriage, and Veysey in spite of his age was
restored. Coverdale was called before the privy council on the
1st of September, and required to find sureties; but he was not
further molested, and when Christian III. of Denmark at the
instance of Coverdale&rsquo;s brother-in-law, MacAlpine, interceded
in his favour, he was in February 1555 permitted to leave for
Denmark with two servants, and his baggage unsearched; one
of these &ldquo;servants&rdquo; is said to have been his wife. He declined
Christian&rsquo;s offer of a living in Denmark, and preferred to preach
at Wesel to the numerous English refugees there, until he was
invited by Duke Wolfgang to resume his labours at Bergzabern.
He was at Geneva in December 1558, and is said to have participated
in the preparation of the Geneva version of the Bible.</p>

<p>In 1559 Coverdale returned to England and resumed his
preaching at St Paul&rsquo;s and elsewhere. Clothed in a plain black
gown, he assisted at Parker&rsquo;s consecration, in spite of the facts
that he had himself been deprived, and did not resume his
bishopric, and that his original appointment had been by the
uncanonical method of letters patent. Conscientious objections
were probably responsible for his non-restoration to the see of
Exeter, and his refusal of that of Llandaff in 1563. He objected
to vestments, and in his living of St Magnus close to London
Bridge, which he received in 1563, he took other liberties with
the Act of Uniformity. His bishop, Grindal, was his friend, and
his vagaries were overlooked until 1566, when he resigned his
living rather than conform. He still preached occasionally, and
always drew large audiences. He died in February 1568, and
was buried on the 19th in St Bartholomew&rsquo;s behind the Exchange.
When this church was pulled down in 1840 to make room for
the new Exchange, his remains were removed to St Magnus.</p>

Branco, formerly included in the province of Beira; on the
eastern slope of the Serra da Estrella, and on the Abrantes-Guarda
railway. Pop. (1900) 15,469. Covilhã, which has been
often compared with a collection of swallows&rsquo; nests clinging to
the rugged granitic mountain side, is shaped like an amphitheatre
of closely crowded houses, overlooking the river Zezere
and its wild valley from a height of 2180 ft. Over 4000 operatives
are employed in the manufacture of <i>saragoça</i>, a coarse brown
cloth worn by the peasantry throughout Portugal. The village

springs and baths.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVILHAM<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Covilhão, Covilhã</span>), <span class="bold">PERO</span> or <span class="sc">Pedro de</span>,
Portuguese explorer and diplomatist (fl. 1487-1525), was a native
of Covilhã in Beira. In early life he had gone to Castile and
entered the service of Alphonso, duke of Seville; later, when war
broke out between Castile and Portugal, he returned to his own
country, and attached himself, first as a &ldquo;groom,&rdquo; then as a
&ldquo;squire,&rdquo; to King Alphonso V. and his successor John II.
On the 7th of May 1487, he was despatched, in company with
Alphonso de Payva, on a mission of exploration in the Levant and
adjoining regions of Asia and Africa, with the special object of
learning where &ldquo;cinnamon and other spices could be found,&rdquo; as
well as of discovering the land of Prester John, by &ldquo;overland&rdquo;
routes. Bartholomeu Diaz, at this very time, went out to find
the Prester&rsquo;s country, as well as the termination of the African
continent and the ocean route to India, by sea. Covilham and
Payva were provided with a &ldquo;letter of credence for all the
countries of the world&rdquo; and with a &ldquo;map for navigating, taken
from the map of the world&rdquo; and compiled by Bishop Calcadilha,
and doctors Rodrigo and Moyses. The first two of these were
prominent members of the commission which advised the
Portuguese government to reject the proposals of Columbus.
The explorers started from Santarem and travelled by Barcelona
to Naples, where their bills of exchange were paid by the sons of
Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici; thence they passed to Rhodes, where they
lodged with two other Portuguese, and so to Alexandria and
Cairo, where they posed as merchants. In company with certain
Moors from Fez and Tlemçen they now went by way of Tor to
Suakin and Aden, where (as it was now monsoon time) they
parted, Covilham proceeding to India and Payva to Ethiopia&mdash;the
two companions agreeing to meet again in Cairo. Covilham
thus arrived at Cannanore and Calicut, whence he retraced his
course to Goa and Ormuz, the Red Sea and Cairo, making an
excursion on his way down the East African coast to Sofala,
which he was probably the first European to visit. At Cairo he
heard of Payva&rsquo;s death, and met with two Portuguese Jews&mdash;Rabbi
Abraham of Beja, and Joseph, a shoe-maker of Lamego&mdash;who
had been sent by King John with letters for Covilham
and Payva. By Joseph of Lamego Covilham replied with an
account of his Indian and African journeys, and of his observations
on the cinnamon, pepper and clove trade at Calicut,
together with advice as to the ocean way to India. This he truly
represented as quite practicable: &ldquo;to this they (of Portugal)
could navigate by their coast and the seas of Guinea.&rdquo; The
first objective in the eastern ocean, he added, was Sofala or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
Island of the Moon, our Madagascar&mdash;&ldquo;from each of these lands
one can fetch the coast of Calicut.&rdquo; With this information
Joseph returned to Portugal, while Covilham, with Abraham of
Beja, again visited Aden and Ormuz. At the latter he left the
rabbi; and himself came back to Jidda, the port of the Arabian
holy land, and penetrated (as he told Alvarez many years later)
even to Mecca and Medina. Finally, by Mount Sinai, Tor and
the Red Sea, he reached Zeila, whence he struck inland to the
court of Prester John (<i>i.e.</i> Abyssinia). Here he was honourably
received; lands and lordships were bestowed upon him; but he
was not permitted to leave. When the Portuguese embassy
under Rodrigo de Lima, including Father Francisco Alvarez,
entered Abyssinia in 1520, Covilham wept with joy at the sight
of his fellow-countrymen. It was then forty years since he had
left Portugal, and over thirty since he had been a prisoner of
state in &ldquo;Ethiopia.&rdquo; Alvarez, who professed to know him well,
and to have heard the story of his life, both &ldquo;in confession and
out of it,&rdquo; praises his power of vivid description &ldquo;as if things
were present before him,&rdquo; and his extraordinary knowledge of
&ldquo;all spoken languages of Christians, Moors and Gentiles.&rdquo; His
services as an interpreter were valuable to Rodrigo de Lima&rsquo;s
embassy; but he never succeeded in escaping from Abyssinia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COVINGTON,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> a city and one of the two county-seats of Kenton
county, Kentucky, U.S.A., on the Ohio river opposite Cincinnati,
with which it is connected by bridges; and at the mouth of the
Licking river (also spanned by bridges), opposite Newport, Ky.
Pop. (1890) 37,371; (1900) 42,938, of whom 5223 were foreign-born
and 2478 were negroes; (1910) 53,270. In 1900 it ranked
second in population among the cities of Kentucky. The
city is served by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, and the Louisville
&amp; Nashville railways, by interurban electric railways, and by
steamboat lines to the Ohio river ports. It is built on a plain
commanding good views and partly shut in by neighbouring
hills. Its streets, mostly named from eminent Kentuckians,
are paved chiefly with asphalt, macadam and brick. There
are numerous fine residences and several attractive public
buildings, including that of the United States government&mdash;modern
Gothic in style&mdash;the court-house and city hall combined,
and the public library. Covington is the seat of a
Roman Catholic bishopric, and its cathedral, in the flamboyant
Gothic style, is one of the finest church buildings in the state.
In the city are the Academy of Notre Dame and St Joseph&rsquo;s
high school for boys, both Roman Catholic. The principal
charitable institutions are the hospital of Saint Elizabeth, a
German orphan asylum, a Protestant children&rsquo;s home, a home
for aged women and a Wayfarers&rsquo; Rest. Covington is the trade
centre of an extensive district engaged in agriculture and stock
raising, and as a manufacturing centre it ranked second in the
state in 1905 (value of factory products $6,099,715), its products
including tobacco, cotton goods, structural iron and steel, foundry
and machine shop products, liquors and cordage. A settlement
was established here in 1812, and three years later a town was laid
out and named in honour of Gen. Leonard Covington (1768-1813),
who was mortally wounded at Chrystler&rsquo;s Field during the War
of 1812. In 1834 Covington was chartered as a city; and in
1908 it annexed Central Covington (pop. in 1900, 2155).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COWARD,<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> a term of contempt for one who, before danger,
pain or trouble, shows fear, whether physical or moral. The
derivation of the word has been obscured by a connexion in sense
with the verb &ldquo;cow,&rdquo; to instil fear into, which is derived from
old Norse <i>kuga</i>, a word of similar meaning, and with the verb
&ldquo;cower,&rdquo; to crouch, which is also Scandinavian in origin.<a name="FnAnchor_1h" id="FnAnchor_1h" href="#Footnote_1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
true derivation is from the French <i>coe</i>, an old form of <i>queue</i>, a
tail, from Lat. <i>cauda</i>, hence <i>couart</i> or <i>couard</i>. The reference to
&ldquo;tail&rdquo; is either to the expression &ldquo;turn tail&rdquo; in flight, or to the
habit of animals dropping the tail between the legs when
frightened; in heraldry, a lion in this position is a &ldquo;lion coward.&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">COWBRIDGE,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> a market town and a municipal and contributory
parliamentary borough of Glamorganshire, Wales, with
a station on the Taff Vale railway branch from Llantrisant to
Aberthaw on the coast, distant by rail 162½ m. from London,
12 m. W. of Cardiff, 7 m. S.E. of Bridgend, and 6 m. S. of Llantrisant
station. The population in 1901 was 1202, a decrease
of over 12% since 1891. Less than one-third of the number was
Welsh-speaking. The town mainly consists of one long street
running east and west, and is in a wide valley through which
runs the river Thaw (Welsh, <i>Ddawan</i>), here crossed by a stone
bridge.</p>

<p>Cowbridge is probably situated on the Roman road from
Cardiff westwards, which seems to have kept nearly the course
of the present main road. Roman coins have been discovered
here. It has in fact been suggested, mainly on etymological
grounds, that the town occupies the site of the Roman <i>Bovium</i>:
the modern Welsh name, y Bontfaen (&ldquo;stone bridge&rdquo;) is
probably a corruption of the medieval, Pont y fôn, the precise
equivalent of &ldquo;Cowbridge,&rdquo; which is first found in documents
of the second half of the 13th century as Covbruge and Cubrigg.
Others place Bovium on a vicinal road, at Boverton near
Llantwit Major, about 6 m. to the south near the coast, though
the most likely site is near Ewenny, 5 m. to the west of Cowbridge.
After the Norman conquest of Glamorgan, the town
grew up as an appanage of the castle of St Quentin, which
occupies a commanding position half a mile south-west of the
town. It was walled round before the 13th century. A tower
is mentioned in 1487 when it was granted away by the burgesses.
Leland in his itinerary (c. 1535) describes the town wall as three-quarters
of a mile round and as having three gates. There was
even then a considerable suburb on the west bank of the river
and outside the walls. The south wall and gateway are still
standing.</p>

<p>The town was a borough by prescription until 1682, when it
received a charter of incorporation from Charles II. confirming
its previous privileges. Under the Unreformed Corporations
Act of 1883 the corporation was dissolved, but on the petition
of the inhabitants a new charter was granted in March 1887.
During the Tudor and Stuart periods Cowbridge was almost
if not quite the chief town of Glamorgan, its importance being
largely due to its central and accessible position in a rich agricultural
district where a large number of the county gentry lived.
The great sessions were held here alternately with Cardiff and
Swansea from 1542 till their abolition in 1830, and the quarter
sessions were held here once a year down to 1850. From 1536
to 1832 it was one of the eight contributory boroughs within the
county which returned a member to parliament, but since 1832
it has been contributory with Cardiff and Llantrisant in returning
a member. It has a separate commission of the peace. Sir
Edward Stradling (1529-1609) established a grammar school
here, but died before endowing it; it was refounded in 1685 by
Sir Leoline Jenkins, who provided that it should be administered
by Jesus College, Oxford, which body erected the present
buildings in 1847. It has throughout its existence been one of
the leading schools in Wales. An intermediate school for girls
was established here by the county in 1896. The church of St
Mary (formerly chapelry to Llanblethian) is of early English
style and has a fine embattled tower, of the same military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
type as the towers of Llamblethian and Ewenny. There are
three Nonconformist chapels. There are a town hall and market
place. The town is now wholly dependent on agriculture, and
has good markets and cattle fairs, that on the 4th of May being
a charter fair.</p>

Ernsborough, Devonshire. He was educated at Eton, and
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, ultimately becoming professor of
civil law in that university, and master of Trinity Hall. In
1607 he compiled a law dictionary, <i>The Interpreter</i>, in which he
exalted the king&rsquo;s prerogative so much that he was prosecuted
before the House of Commons by Sir Edward Coke, and saved
from imprisonment only by the interposition of James I. His
book was burnt by order of the House of Commons. Dr Cowell
also wrote a work entitled <i>Institutiones Juris Anglicani</i>. He
died at Oxford on the 11th of October 1611.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COWEN, FREDERIC HYMEN<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (1852-&emsp;&emsp;), English musical
composer, was born at Kingston, Jamaica, on the 29th of January
1852. At four years old he was brought to England, where his
father became treasurer to the opera at Her Majesty&rsquo;s theatre,
and private secretary to the earl of Dudley. His first teacher
was Henry Russell, and his first published composition appeared
when he was but six years old. He studied the piano with
Benedict, and composition with Goss; in 1865 he was at Leipzig
under Hauptmann, Moscheles, Reinecke and Plaidy. Returning
home on the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, he appeared
as a composer for the orchestra in an overture played at the
Promenade Concerts at Covent Garden in September 1866. In
the following autumn he went to Berlin, where he was under
Kiel, at Stern&rsquo;s conservatorium. A symphony and a piano
concerto were given in St James&rsquo;s Hall in 1869, and from that
time Cowen has been recognized as primarily a composer, his
talents as a pianist being subordinate, although his public
appearances were numerous for some time afterwards. His
cantata, <i>The Rose Maiden</i>, was given in London in 1870, his
second symphony by the Liverpool Philharmonic Society in 1872,
and his first festival work, <i>The Corsair</i>, in 1876 at Birmingham.
In that year his opera, <i>Pauline</i>, was given by the Carl Rosa
Company with moderate success. In 1884 he conducted five
concerts of the Philharmonic Society, and in 1888, on the
resignation of Arthur Sullivan, became the regular conductor
of the society, resigning the post in 1892. In the year of his
appointment, 1888, he went to Melbourne as the conductor of
the daily concerts given in connexion with the Exhibition there.
In 1896 Cowen was appointed conductor of the Liverpool
Philharmonic Society and of the Manchester orchestra, in succession
to Sir Charles Hallé. In 1899 he was reappointed conductor
of the Philharmonic Society. His works include:&mdash;Operettas:
<i>Garibaldi</i> (1860) and <i>One Too Many</i> (1874); operas: <i>Pauline</i>
(1876), <i>Thorgrim</i> (1890), <i>Signa</i> (Milan, 1893), and <i>Harold</i> (1895);
oratorios: <i>The Deluge</i> (1878), <i>St Ursula</i> (1881), <i>Ruth</i> (1887),
<i>Song of Thanksgiving</i> (1888), <i>The Transfiguration</i> (1895);
cantatas: <i>The Rose Maiden</i> (1870), <i>The Corsair</i> (1876), <i>The
Sleeping Beauty</i> (1885), <i>St John&rsquo;s Eve</i> (1889), <i>The Water Lily</i>
(1893), <i>Ode to the Passions</i> (1898), besides short cantatas for
female voices; a large number of songs, ranging from the popular
&ldquo;ballad&rdquo; to more artistic lyrics, anthems, part-songs, duets,
&amp;c.; six symphonies, among which No 3, the &ldquo;Scandinavian,&rdquo;
has had the greatest success; four overtures; suites, <i>The
Language of Flowers</i> (1880), <i>In the Olden Times</i> (1883), <i>In Fairyland</i>
(1896); four English dances (1896); a concerto for piano
and orchestra, and a fantasia for the same played by M.
Paderewski (1900); a quartet in C minor, and a trio in A minor,
both early works; pianoforte pieces, &amp;c. Cowen is never so
happy as when treating of fantastic or fairy subjects; and
whether in his cantatas for female voices, his charming <i>Sleeping</i>
<i>Beauty</i>, his <i>Water Lily</i> or his pretty overture, <i>The Butterfly&rsquo;s
Ball</i> (1901), he succeeds wonderfully in finding graceful expression
for the poetical idea. His dance music, such as is to be found
in various orchestral suites, is refined, original and admirably
instrumented; and if he is seldom as successful in portraying
the graver aspects of emotion, the vogue of his semi-sacred songs
has been widespread.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COWEN, JOSEPH<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (1831-1900), English politician and
journalist, son of Sir Joseph Cowen, a prominent citizen and
mine-owner of Newcastle-on-Tyne, was born in 1831, and was
educated at Edinburgh University. In 1874 he was elected
member of parliament for the borough on the death of his father,
who had held the seat as a Liberal since 1865. Joseph Cowen was
at that time a strong Radical on domestic questions, an advocate
of co-operation, an admirer of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Kossuth, a
sympathizer with Irish Nationalism, and one who in speech,
dress and manner identified himself with the North-country
mining class. Short in stature and uncouth in appearance, his
individuality first shocked and then by its earnestness impressed
the House of Commons; and his sturdy independence of party
ties, combined with a gift of rough but genuine eloquence (of
which his speech on the Royal Title Bill of 1876 was an example),
rapidly made him one of the best-known public men in the
country. He was, moreover, an Imperialist and a Colonial
Federationist at a time when Liberalism was tied and bound to the
Manchester traditions; and, to the consternation of the official
wire-pullers, he vigorously supported Disraeli&rsquo;s foreign policy,
and in 1881 opposed the Gladstonian settlement with the Boers.
His independence (which his detractors attributed in some
degree to his alleged susceptibility to Tory compliments) brought
him into collision both with the Liberal caucus and with the
party organization in Newcastle itself, but Cowen&rsquo;s personal
popularity and his remarkable powers as an orator triumphed
in his own birthplace, and he was again elected in 1885 in spite of
Liberal opposition. Shortly afterwards, however, he retired
both from parliament and from public life, professing his disgust
at the party intrigues of politics, and devoted himself to conducting
his newspaper, the <i>Newcastle Daily Chronicle</i>, and to his
private business as a mine-owner. In this capacity he exercised
a wide influence on local opinion, and the revolt of the Newcastle
electorate in later years against doctrinaire Radicalism was
largely due to his constant preaching of a broader outlook on
national affairs. He continued behind the scenes to play a
powerful part in forming North-country opinion until his death
on the 18th of February 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COWES,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> a seaport and watering-place in the Isle of Wight,
England, 12 m. S.S.E. of Southampton. West Cowes is separated
from East Cowes by the picturesque estuary of the river
Medina, the two towns (each of which is an urban district)
lying on opposite sides of its mouth at the apex of the northern
coast of the island. Pop. (1901) West Cowes, 8652; East Cowes,
3196. The port between them is the chief on the island, and is
the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron (founded in 1812);
it is in regular steamship communication with Southampton and
Portsmouth. West Cowes is served by the Isle of Wight Central
railway. A steam ferry and a floating bridge across the Medina,
here 600 yds. broad, unite the towns. Behind the harbour the
houses rise picturesquely on gentle wooded slopes, and numerous
villas adorn the vicinity. The towns owe their origin to two
forts or castles, built on each side of the mouth of the Medina by
Henry VIII. in 1540, for the defence of the coast; the eastern
one has disappeared, but the west castle remains and is used as
the club-house of the Yacht Squadron. The marine parade of
West Cowes, and the public promenade called the Green, are
close to the castle. The industrial population is chiefly employed
in the shipbuilding yards, in the manufacture of ships&rsquo; fittings,
and in engineering works. The harbour is under an elective
body of commissioners. On the opposite side of the Medina a
broad carriageway leads to East Cowes Castle, a handsome
edifice built by John Nash, the favourite architect of George IV.,
in 1798, and immediately beyond it are the grounds surrounding

<p><span class="bold">COWL<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (through Fr. <i>coule</i>, from Lat. <i>cucullus</i> or <i>cuculla</i>, a
covering; the word is found in various forms in most European
languages, cf. Ger. <i>Kugel</i> or <i>Kigel</i>, Dutch <i>kovel</i>, Irish <i>cochal</i> or
<i>cochull</i>; the ultimate origin may be the root <i>kal</i>, found in Lat.
<i>clam</i>, secretly, and Gr. <span class="grk" title="kalyptein">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to hide, cover up), an outer
garment worn by both sexes in the middle ages; a part of the
monastic dress, hence the phrase &ldquo;to take the cowl,&rdquo; signifying
entry upon the religious life. The <i>cucullus</i> worn by the early
Egyptian anchorites was a hood covering the head and neck.
Later generations lengthened the garment until it reached to the
heels, and St Benedict issued a rule restricting its length to two
cubits. Chapter 55 of his <i>Institute</i> prescribes the following dress
in temperate climates: a cowl and tunic, thick in winter and
thin in summer, with a scapular for working hours and shoes and
stockings, all of simple material and make. In the 14th century
the cowl and the frock were frequently confounded, but the
council of Vienne defined the former as &ldquo;a habit long and full
without sleeves,&rdquo; and the latter as &ldquo;a long habit with long and
wide sleeves.&rdquo; While the term thus seems strictly to imply a
hooded gown it is often applied to the hood alone. It is also
used to describe a loose vestment worn over the frock in the
winter season and during the night office.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;cowl&rdquo; is also applied to a hood-shaped covering
to a chimney or ventilating shaft, to help down-draught, and to
clear the up-current of foul air (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ventilation</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COWLEY, ABRAHAM<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1618-1667), English poet, was born in
the city of London late in 1618. His father, a wealthy citizen,
who died shortly before his birth, was a stationer. His mother
was wholly given to works of devotion, but it happened that
there lay in her parlour a copy of <i>The Faery Queen</i>. This became
the favourite reading of her son, and he had twice devoured it all
before he was sent to school. As early as 1628, that is, in his
tenth year, he composed his <i>Tragicall History of Piramus and
Thisbe</i>, an epical romance written in a six-line stanza, of his own
invention. It is not too much to say that this work is the most
astonishing feat of imaginative precocity on record; it is
marked by no great faults of immaturity, and possesses constructive
merits of a very high order. Two years later the child
wrote another and still more ambitious poem, <i>Constantia and
Philetus</i>, being sent about the same time to Westminster school.
Here he displayed the most extraordinary mental precocity and
versatility, and wrote in his thirteenth year yet another poem,
the <i>Elegy on the Death of Dudley, Lord Carlton</i>. These three
poems of considerable size, and some smaller ones, were collected
in 1633, and published in a volume entitled <i>Poetical Blossoms</i>,
dedicated to the head master of the school, and prefaced by
many laudatory verses by schoolfellows. The author at once
became famous, although he had not, even yet, completed his
fifteenth year. His next composition was a pastoral comedy,
entitled <i>Love&rsquo;s Riddle</i>, a marvellous production for a boy of
sixteen, airy, correct and harmonious in language, and rapid in
movement. The style is not without resemblance to that of
Randolph, whose earliest works, however, were at that time only
just printed. In 1637 Cowley was elected into Trinity College,
Cambridge, where he betook himself with enthusiasm to the
study of all kinds of learning, and early distinguished himself as a
ripe scholar. It was about this time that he composed his
scriptural epic on the history of King David, one book of which
still exists in the Latin original, the rest being superseded in
favour of an English version in four books, called the <i>Davideis</i>,
which he published a long time after. This his most grave and
important work is remarkable as having suggested to Milton
several points which he afterwards made use of. The epic,
written in a very dreary and turgid manner, but in good rhymed
heroic verse, deals with the adventures of King David from his
boyhood to the smiting of Amalek by Saul, where it abruptly
closes. In 1638 <i>Love&rsquo;s Riddle</i> and a Latin comedy, the <i>Naufragium
Joculare</i>, were printed, and in 1641 the passage of Prince
Charles through Cambridge gave occasion to the production of
another dramatic work, <i>The Guardian</i>, which was acted before
the royal visitor with much success. During the civil war this
play was privately performed at Dublin, but it was not printed
till 1650. It is bright and amusing, in the style common to the
&ldquo;sons&rdquo; of Ben Jonson, the university wits who wrote more
for the closet than the public stage.</p>

<p>The learned quiet of the young poet&rsquo;s life was broken up by
the Civil War; he warmly espoused the royalist side. He became
a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, but was ejected by the
Parliamentarians in 1643. He made his way to Oxford, where he
enjoyed the friendship of Lord Falkland, and was tossed, in the
tumult of affairs, into the personal confidence of the royal family
itself. After the battle of Marston Moor he followed the queen to
Paris, and the exile so commenced lasted twelve years. This
period was spent almost entirely in the royal service, &ldquo;bearing
a share in the distresses of the royal family, or labouring in their
affairs. To this purpose he performed several dangerous journeys
into Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, or wherever else the
king&rsquo;s troubles required his attendance. But the chief testimony
of his fidelity was the laborious service he underwent in maintaining
the constant correspondence between the late king and the
queen his wife. In that weighty trust he behaved himself with
indefatigable integrity and unsuspected secrecy; for he ciphered
and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of all the
letters that passed between their majesties, and managed a vast
intelligence in many other parts, which for some years together
took up all his days, and two or three nights every week.&rdquo; In
spite of these labours he did not refrain from literary industry.
During his exile he met with the works of Pindar, and determined
to reproduce their lofty lyric passion in English. At the same
time he occupied himself in writing a history of the Civil War,
which he completed as far as the battle of Newbury, but unfortunately
afterwards destroyed. In 1647 a collection of his love
verses, entitled <i>The Mistress</i>, was published, and in the next year
a volume of wretched satires, <i>The Four Ages of England</i>, was
brought out under his name, with the composition of which he
had nothing to do. In spite of the troubles of the times, so fatal
to poetic fame, his reputation steadily increased, and when, on
his return to England in 1656, he published a volume of his
collected poetical works, he found himself without a rival in
public esteem. This volume included the later works already
mentioned, the <i>Pindarique Odes</i>, the <i>Davideis</i>, the <i>Mistress</i> and
some <i>Miscellanies</i>. Among the latter are to be found Cowley&rsquo;s
most vital pieces. This section of his works opens with the
famous aspiration&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do to be for ever known,</p>
<p class="i05">And make the coming age my own?&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">It contains elegies on Wotton, Vandyck, Falkland, William
Hervey and Crashaw, the last two being among Cowley&rsquo;s finest
poems, brilliant, sonorous and original; the amusing ballad of
<i>The Chronicle</i>, giving a fictitious catalogue of his supposed
amours; various gnomic pieces; and some charming paraphrases
from Anacreon. The <i>Pindarique Odes</i> contain weighty
lines and passages, buried in irregular and inharmonious masses
of moral verbiage. Not more than one or two are good throughout,
but a full posy of beauties may easily be culled from them.
The long cadences of the Alexandrines with which most of the
strophes close, continued to echo in English poetry from Dryden
down to Gray, but the <i>Odes</i> themselves, which were found to be
obscure by the poet&rsquo;s contemporaries, immediately fell into
disesteem. <i>The Mistress</i> was the most popular poetic reading of
the age, and is now the least read of all Cowley&rsquo;s works. It was
the last and most violent expression of the amatory affectation of
the 17th century, an affectation which had been endurable in
Donne and other early writers because it had been the vehicle of
sincere emotion, but was unendurable in Cowley because in him it
represented nothing but a perfunctory exercise, a mere exhibition
of literary calisthenics. He appears to have been of a cold, or at
least of a timid, disposition; in the face of these elaborately
erotic volumes, we are told that to the end of his days he never
summoned up courage to speak of love to a single woman in real
life. The &ldquo;Leonora&rdquo; of <i>The Chronicle</i> is said to have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
only woman he ever loved, and she married the brother of his
biographer, Sprat.</p>

<p>Soon after his return to England he was seized in mistake for
another person, and only obtained his liberty on a bail of £1000.
In 1658 he revised and altered his play of <i>The Guardian</i>, and
prepared it for the press under the title of <i>The Cutter of Coleman
Street</i>, but it did not appear until 1663. Late in 1658 Oliver
Cromwell died, and Cowley took advantage of the confusion of
affairs to escape to Paris, where he remained until the Restoration
brought him back in Charles&rsquo;s train. He published in 1663
<i>Verses upon several occasions</i>, in which <i>The Complaint</i> is
included.</p>

<p>Wearied with the broils and fatigues of a political life, Cowley
obtained permission to retire into the country; through his
friend, Lord St Albans, he obtained a property near Chertsey,
and here, devoting himself to the study of botany, and buried in
his books, he lived in comparative solitude until his death. He
took a great and practical interest in experimental science, and he
was one of those who were most prominent in advocating the
foundation of an academy for the protection of scientific enterprise.
Cowley&rsquo;s pamphlet on <i>The Advancement of Experimental
Philosophy</i>, 1661, led directly to the foundation of the Royal
Society, to which body Cowley, in March 1667, at the suggestion
of Evelyn, addressed an ode which is the latest and one of the
strongest of his poems. He died in the Porch House, in Chertsey,
on the 28th of July 1667, in consequence of having caught a cold
while superintending his farm-labourers in the meadows late on a
summer evening. On the 3rd of August Cowley was buried in
Westminster Abbey beside the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser,
where in 1675 the duke of Buckingham erected a monument to his
memory. His <i>Poëmata Latina</i>, including six books &ldquo;Plantarum,&rdquo;
were printed in 1668.</p>

<p>Throughout their parallel lives the fame of Cowley completely
eclipsed that of Milton, but posterity instantly and finally reversed
the judgment of their contemporaries. The poetry of Cowley
rapidly fell into a neglect as unjust as the earlier popularity had
been. As a prose writer, especially as an essayist, he holds, and
will not lose, a high position in literature; as a poet it is hardly
possible that he can enjoy more than a very partial revival.
The want of nature, the obvious and awkward art, the defective
melody of his poems, destroy the interest that their ingenuity and
occasional majesty would otherwise excite. He had lofty views
of the mission of a poet and an insatiable ambition, but his chief
claim to poetic life is the dowry of sonorous lyric style which he
passed down to Dryden and his successors of the 18th century.</p>

<p>The works of Cowley were collected in 1668, when Thomas Sprat,
afterwards bishop of Rochester, brought out a splendid edition
in folio, to which he prefixed a graceful and elegant life of the
poet. There were many reprints of this collection, which formed
the standard edition till 1881, when it was superseded by A. B.
Grosart&rsquo;s privately printed edition in two volumes, for the Chertsey
Worthies library. The Essays have frequently been revived with
approval.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COWLEY, HANNAH<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1743-1809), English dramatist and poet,
daughter of Philip Parkhouse, a bookseller at Tiverton, Devonshire,
was born in 1743. When about twenty-five years old she
married Mr Cowley, of the East India Company&rsquo;s service, who
died in 1797. Some years after her marriage, being at the theatre
with her husband, she expressed the opinion that she could
write as good a piece as the one being performed, and within a
fortnight she had written her first play, <i>The Runaway</i>. She sent
it to Garrick, who produced it at Drury Lane in 1776. Between
then and 1795 she wrote twelve more plays, all of which (with one
exception) were produced at Drury Lane or Covent Garden; and
<i>The Belle&rsquo;s Stratagem</i> (1782), with one or two others, still survives
in the list of acting plays. Among other, pieces were <i>Albina</i>,
<i>Countess Raimond</i>, <i>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</i>, <i>More Ways
than One</i>, and <i>A School for Greybeards, or The Mourning Bride</i>.
Mrs Cowley was the author of a number of indifferent poems,
mainly historical, and under the name of &ldquo;Anna Matilda,&rdquo;
which has since become proverbial, she carried on a sentimental
correspondence in the <i>World</i> with Robert Merry. She died at
Tiverton on the 11th of March 1809.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COWLEY, HENRY RICHARD CHARLES WELLESLEY,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st
Earl</span> (1804-1884), British diplomatist, was the eldest son of
Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley (1773-1847), and Charlotte,
daughter of Charles, 1st Earl Cadogan, and was consequently a
nephew of the duke of Wellington and of the marquess Wellesley.
Born on the 17th of June 1804, he entered the diplomatic service
in 1824, receiving his first important appointment in 1848, when
he became minister plenipotentiary to the Swiss cantons; and
in the same year he was sent to Frankfort to watch the proceedings
of the German parliament. This was followed by his
appointment as envoy extraordinary to the new Germanic
confederation, a position which he only held for a short time,
as he was chosen in 1852 to succeed the 1st marquess of Normanby
as the British ambassador in Paris. Baron Cowley, as Wellesley
had been since his father&rsquo;s death in 1847, held this important
post for fifteen years, and the story of his diplomatic life in Paris
cannot be separated from the general history of England and
France. As minister during the greater part of the reign of
Napoleon III., he conducted the delicate negotiations between
the two countries during the time of those eastern complications
which preceded and followed the Crimean War, and also during
the excitement and unrest produced by the attempt made in
1858 by Felice Orsini to assassinate the <span class="correction" title="amended from emporor">emperor</span> of the French;
while his diplomatic skill was no less in evidence during the war
between France and Austria and the subsequent course of events
in Italy. In 1857 he had been created Earl Cowley and Viscount
Dangan; in 1866 he was made a knight of the Garter; and
having assisted Richard Cobden to conclude the commercial
treaty between Great Britain and France in 1860, he retired in
1867 from a position which he had filled with distinction to
himself and with benefit to his country. In 1863 Cowley had
inherited the estate of Draycot in Wiltshire from his kinsman
the 5th earl of Mornington, and he lived in retirement until his
death on the 15th of July 1884. He had married in 1833 Olivia
Cecilia (d. 1885), daughter of Charlotte, baroness de Ros and
Lord Henry Fitzgerald, by whom he had three sons and two
daughters, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son,
William Henry, 2nd Earl Cowley (1834-1895), father of Henry
Arthur Mornington, 3rd earl (b. 1866).</p>

on the 17th of January 1781, during the War of American
Independence, between the Americans under Gen. Daniel
Morgan and the British under Gen. Banastre Tarleton, the
British being defeated. A monument was erected on the battlefield
in 1859, but was much defaced during the Civil War. The
town of Cowpens was founded in 1876, and was incorporated
in 1880.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COWPER, WILLIAM COWPER,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl</span> (c. 1665-1723),
lord chancellor of England, was the son of Sir William Cowper,
Bart., of Ratling Court, Kent, a Whig member of parliament
of some mark in the two last Stuart reigns. Educated at St
Albans school, Cowper was called to the bar in 1688; having
promptly given his allegiance to the prince of Orange on his
landing in England, he was made recorder of Colchester in 1694,
and in 1695 entered parliament as member for Hertford. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
enjoyed a large practice at the bar, and had the reputation of
being one of the most effective parliamentary orators of his
generation. He lost his seat in parliament in 1702 owing to
the unpopularity caused by the trial of his brother Spencer on
a charge of murder. In 1705 he was appointed lord keeper of
the great seal, and took his seat on the woolsack without a peerage.
In the following year he conducted the negotiations between the
English and Scottish commissioners for arranging the union
with Scotland. In November of the same year (1706) he succeeded
to his father&rsquo;s baronetcy; and on the 14th of December he was
raised to the peerage as Baron Cowper of Wingham, Kent.</p>

<p>When the union with Scotland came into operation in May
1707 the queen in council named Cowper lord high chancellor
of Great Britain, he being the first to hold this office. He presided
at the trial of Dr Sacheverell in 1710, but resigned the seal when
Harley and Bolingbroke took office in the same year. On the
death of Queen Anne, George I. appointed Cowper one of the
lords justices for governing the country during the king&rsquo;s
absence, and a few weeks later he again became lord chancellor.
A paper which he drew up for the guidance of the new king on
constitutional matters, entitled <i>An Impartial History of Parties</i>,
marks the advance of English opinion towards party government
in the modern sense. It was published by Lord Campbell in
his <i>Lives of the Lord Chancellors</i>. Cowper supported the impeachment
of Lord Oxford for high treason in 1715, and in 1716
presided as lord high steward at the trials of the peers charged
with complicity in the Jacobite rising, his sentences on whom
have been censured as unnecessarily severe. He warmly supported
the septennial bill in the same year. On the 18th of
March 1718 he was created Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper,
and a month later he resigned office on the plea of ill-health, but
probably in reality because George I. accused him of espousing
the prince of Wales&rsquo;s side in his quarrel with the king. Taking
the lead against his former colleagues, Cowper opposed the
proposal brought forward in 1719 to limit the number of peers,
and also the bill of pains and penalties against Atterbury in
1723. In his last years he was accused, but probably without
reason, of active sympathy with the Jacobites. He died at his
residence, Colne Green, built by himself on the site of the present
mansion of Panshanger on the 10th of October 1723.</p>

<p>Cowper was not a great lawyer, but Burnet says that &ldquo;he
managed the court of chancery with impartial justice and great
despatch&rdquo;; the most eminent of his contemporaries agreed in
extolling his oratory and his virtues. He was twice married&mdash;first,
about 1686, to Judith, daughter and heiress of Sir Robert
Booth, a London merchant; and secondly, in 1706, to Mary,
daughter of John Clavering, of Chopwell, Durham. Swift
(<i>Examiner</i>, xvii., xxii.) alludes to an allegation that Cowper
had been guilty of bigamy, a slander for which there appears to
have been no solid foundation. His younger brother, Spencer
Cowper (1669-1728), was tried for the murder of Sarah Stout in
1699, but was acquitted; the lady, who had fallen in love with
Cowper, having in fact committed suicide on account of his
inattention. He was one of the managers of the impeachment
of Sacheverell; was attorney-general to the prince of Wales
(1714), chief justice of Chester (1717), and judge of the common
pleas (1727). He was grandfather of William Cowper, the poet.</p>

<p>The 1st earl left two sons and two daughters by his second
wife. The eldest son, William (1709-1764), who succeeded to
the title, assumed the name of Clavering in addition to that of
Cowper on the death of his maternal uncle. His wife was a
daughter of the earl of Grantham, and grand-daughter of the
earl of Ossory. The son of this marriage, George Nassau, 3rd
Earl Cowper (1738-1789), inherited the estates of the earl of
Grantham; and in 1778 he was created by the emperor Joseph
II. a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The 5th earl (1778-1837)
married a daughter of Lord Melbourne, the prime minister,
by whom he had two sons; and his widow married as her second
husband Lord Palmerston, who devised his property of Broadlands
to her second son, William Francis Cowper-Temple (1811-1888),
who was created Baron Mount Temple in 1880. The
elder son, George Augustus Frederick (1806-1856), 6th Earl
Cowper, married Anne Florence, daughter of Thomas Philip,
earl de Grey; and this lady at her father&rsquo;s death became <i>suo
jure</i> baroness Lucas of Cradwell. Francis Thomas de Grey,
7th Earl Cowper (1834-1905), in addition to the other family
titles, became in 1871 10th Baron Dingwall in the peerage of
Scotland, and 8th Baron Butler of Moore Park in the peerage
of Ireland as heir-general of Thomas, earl of Ossory, son of the
1st duke of Ormonde; the attainder of 1715 affecting those
titles having been reversed in July 1871. On the death of his
mother he also inherited the barony of Lucas of Cradwell. On
the death without issue in 1905 of the 7th earl, who was lord
lieutenant of Ireland 1880-1882, the earldom and barony of
Cowper, together with the viscountcy of Fordwich, became
extinct; the barony of Butler fell into abeyance among his
sisters and their heirs, and the baronies of Lucas and Dingwall
devolved on his nephew, Auberon Thomas Herbert (b. 1876).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COWPER, WILLIAM<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1731-1800), English poet, was born in
the rectory (now rebuilt) of Great Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire,
on the 26th of November (O.S. 15th) 1731, his father the Rev.
John Cowper being rector of the parish as well as a chaplain to
George II. On both the father&rsquo;s and the mother&rsquo;s side he was
of ancient lineage. The father could trace his family back to
the time of Edward IV. when the Cowpers were Sussex landowners,
while his mother, Ann, daughter of Roger Donne of
Ludham Hall, Norfolk, was of the same race as the poet Donne,
and the family claimed to have Plantagenet blood in its veins.
Of more human interest were Cowper&rsquo;s immediate predecessors.
His grandfather was that Spencer Cowper who, after being tried
for his life on a charge of murder, lived to be a judge of the court
of common pleas, while his elder brother became lord chancellor
and Earl Cowper, a title which became extinct in 1905. Here is
the poet&rsquo;s genealogical tree.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:526px; height:321px" src="images/img349.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Rev. John Cowper was twice married. Cowper&rsquo;s mother,
to whom the memorable lines were written beginning &ldquo;Oh that
these lips had language,&rdquo; was his first wife. She died in 1737
at the age of thirty-four, when the poet was but six years old,
and she is buried in Berkhampstead church. Cowper&rsquo;s stepmother
is buried in Bath, and a tablet on the walls of the cathedral
commemorates her memory. The father, who appears to have
been a conscientious clergyman with no special interest in his
sons, died in 1756 and was buried in the Cowper tomb at Panshanger.
Only one other of his seven children grew to manhood&mdash;John,
who was born in 1737.</p>

<p>The poet appears to have attended a dame&rsquo;s school in earliest
infancy, but on his mother&rsquo;s death, when he was six years old,
he was sent to boarding-school, to a Dr Pitman at Markyate, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
village 6 m. from Berkhampstead. From 1738 to 1741 he was
placed in the care of an oculist, as he suffered from inflammation
of the eyes. In the latter year he was sent to Westminster
school, where he had Warren Hastings, Impey, Lloyd, Churchill
and Colman for schoolfellows. It was at the Markyate school
that he suffered the tyranny that he commemorated in <i>Tirocinium</i>.
His days at Westminster, Southey thinks, were &ldquo;probably the
happiest in his life,&rdquo; but a boy of nervous temperament is always
unhappy at school. At the age of eighteen Cowper entered a
solicitor&rsquo;s office in Ely Place, Holborn. Here he had Thurlow,
the future lord chancellor, as a fellow-clerk, and it is stated that
Thurlow promised to help his less pushful comrade in the days
of realized ambition. Three years in Ely Place were rendered
happy by frequent visits to his uncle Ashley&rsquo;s house in Southampton
Row, where he fell deeply in love with his cousin
Theodora Cowper. At twenty-one years of age he took chambers
in the Middle Temple, where we first hear of the dejection of
spirits that accompanied him periodically through manhood.
He was called to the bar in 1754. In 1759 he removed to the
Inner Temple and was made a commissioner of bankrupts. His
devotion to his cousin, however, was a source of unhappiness. Her
father, possibly influenced by Cowper&rsquo;s melancholy tendencies,
perhaps possessed by prejudices against the marriage of cousins,
interposed, and the lovers were separated&mdash;as it turned out for
ever. During three years he was a member of the Nonsense
Club with his two schoolfellows from Westminster, Churchill
and Lloyd, and he wrote sundry verses in magazines and translated
two books of Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Henriade</i>. A crisis occurred in
Cowper&rsquo;s life when his cousin Major Cowper nominated him to
a clerkship in the House of Lords. It involved a preliminary
appearance at the bar of the house. The prospect drove him
insane, and he attempted suicide; he purchased poison, he placed
a penknife at his heart, but hesitated to apply either measure
of self-destruction. He has told, in dramatic manner, of his
more desperate endeavour to hang himself with a garter. Here
he all but succeeded. His friends were informed, and he was
sent to a private lunatic asylum at St Albans, where he remained
for eighteen months under the charge of Dr Nathaniel Cotton,
the author of <i>Visions</i>. Upon his recovery he removed to
Huntingdon in order to be near his brother John, who was a
fellow of St Benet&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. John had visited his
brother at St Albans and arranged this. An attempt to secure
suitable lodgings nearer to Cambridge had been ineffectual. In
June 1765 he reached Huntingdon, and his life here was essentially
happy. His illness had broken him off from all his old friends
save only his cousin Lady Hesketh, Theodora&rsquo;s sister, but new
acquaintances were made, the Unwins being the most valued.
This family consisted of Morley Unwin (a clergyman), his wife
Mary, and his son (William) and daughter (Susannah). The son
struck up a warm friendship which his family shared. Cowper
entered the circle as a boarder in November (1765). All went
serenely until in July 1767 Morley Unwin was thrown from his
horse and killed. A very short time before this event the Unwins
had received a visit from the Rev. John Newton (<i>q.v.</i>), the curate
of Olney in Buckinghamshire, with whom they became friends.
Newton suggested that the widow and her children with Cowper
should take up their abode in Olney. This was achieved in the
closing months of 1767. Here Cowper was to reside for nineteen
years, and he was to render the town and its neighbourhood
memorable by his presence and by his poetry. His residence
in the Market Place was converted into a Cowper Museum a
hundred years after his death, in 1900. Here his life went on its
placid course, interrupted only by the death of his brother in
1770, until 1773, when he became again deranged. It can scarcely
be doubted that this second attack interrupted the contemplated
marriage of Cowper with Mary Unwin, although Southey could
find no evidence of the circumstance and Newton was not informed
of it. J. C. Bailey brings final evidence of this (<i>The
Poems of Cowper</i>, page 15). The fact was kept secret in later
years in order to spare the feelings of Theodora Cowper, who
thought that her cousin had remained as faithful as she had done
to their early love.</p>

<p>It was not until 1776 that the poet&rsquo;s mind cleared again. In
1779 he made his first appearance as an author by the <i>Olney
Hymns</i>, written in conjunction with Newton, Cowper&rsquo;s verses
being indicated by a &ldquo;C.&rdquo; Mrs Unwin suggested secular verse,
and Cowper wrote much, and in 1782 when he was fifty-one
years old there appeared <i>Poems of William Cowper of the Inner
Temple, Esq.: London, Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72 St Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard</i>. The volume contained &ldquo;Table Talk,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Progress of Error,&rdquo; &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Expostulation&rdquo; and much else
that survives to be read in our day by virtue of the poet&rsquo;s finer
work. This finer work was the outcome of his friendship with
Lady Austen, a widow who, on a visit to her sister, the wife of the
vicar of the neighbouring village of Clifton, made the acquaintance
of Cowper and Mrs Unwin. The three became great friends.
Lady Austen determined to give up her house in London and to
settle in Olney. She suggested <i>The Task</i> and inspired <i>John
Gilpin</i> and <i>The Royal George</i>. But in 1784 the friendship was at
an end, doubtless through Mrs Unwin&rsquo;s jealousy of Lady Austen.
Cowper&rsquo;s second volume appeared in 1785;&mdash;<i>The Task: A Poem
in Six Books. By William Cowper of the Inner Temple, Esq.; To
which are added by the same author An Epistle to Joseph Hill, Esq.,
Tirocinium or a Review of Schools, and the History of John
Gilpin: London, Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72 St Paul&rsquo;s Church
Yard; 1785.</i> His first book had been a failure, one critic even
declaring that &ldquo;Mr Cowper was certainly a good, pious man, but
without one spark of poetic fire.&rdquo; This second book was an
instantaneous success, and indeed marks an epoch in literary
history. But before its publication&mdash;in 1784&mdash;the poet had
commenced the translation of Homer. In 1786 his life at Olney
was cheered by Lady Hesketh taking up a temporary residence
there. The cousins met after an interval of twenty-three years,
and Lady Hesketh was to be Cowper&rsquo;s good angel to the end, even
though her letters disclose a considerable impatience with Mrs
Unwin. At the end of 1786 a removal was made to Weston
Underwood, the neighbouring village which Cowper had
frequently visited as the guest of his Roman Catholic friends the
Throckmortons. This was to be his home for yet another ten
years. Here he completed his translation of Homer, materially
assisted by Mr Throckmorton&rsquo;s chaplain Dr Gregson. There are
six more months of insanity to record in 1787. In 1790, a
year before the <i>Homer</i> was published, commenced his friendship
with his cousin John Johnson, known to all biographers of the
poet as &ldquo;Johnny of Norfolk.&rdquo; Johnson also aspired to be a
poet, and visited his cousin armed with a manuscript. Cowper
discouraged the poetry, but loved the writer, and the two
became great friends. New friends were wanted, for in 1792 Mrs
Unwin had a paralytic stroke, and henceforth she was a hopeless
invalid. A new and valued friend of this period was Hayley,
famous in his own day as a poet and in history for his association
with Romney and Cowper. He was drawn to Cowper by the fact
that both were contemplating an edition of &ldquo;Milton,&rdquo; Cowper
having received a commission to edit, writing notes and translating
the Latin and Italian poems. The work was never completed.
In 1794 Cowper was again insane and his lifework was
over. In the following year a removal took place into Norfolk
under the loving care of John Johnson. Johnson took Cowper and
Mary Unwin to North Tuddenham, thence to Mundesley, then to
Dunham Lodge, near Swaffham, and finally in October 1796 they
moved to East Dereham. In December of that year Mrs Unwin
died. Cowper lingered on, dying on the 25th of April 1800. The
poet is buried near Mrs Unwin in East Dereham church.</p>

<p>Cowper is among the poets who are epoch-makers. He brought
a new spirit into English verse, and redeemed it from the artificiality
and the rhetoric of many of his predecessors. With him
began the &ldquo;enthusiasm of humanity&rdquo; that was afterwards to
become so marked in the poetry of Burns and Shelley, Wordsworth
and Byron. With him began the deep sympathy with
nature, and love of animal life, which was to characterize so
much of later poetry.</p>

<p>Although Cowper cannot rank among the world&rsquo;s greatest
poets or even among the most distinguished of poets of his own
country, his place is a very high one. He had what is a rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
quality among English poets, the gift of humour, which was very
singularly absent from others who possessed many other of the
higher qualities of the intellect. Certain of his poems, moreover,&mdash;for
example, &ldquo;To Mary,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Receipt of my Mother&rsquo;s
Portrait,&rdquo; and the ballad &ldquo;On the Loss of the Royal George,&rdquo;&mdash;will,
it may safely be affirmed, continue to be familiar to each
successive generation in a way that pertains to few things in
literature. Added to this, one may note Cowper&rsquo;s distinction as a
letter-writer. He ranks among the half-dozen greatest letter-writers
in the English language, and he was perhaps the only
great letter-writer with whom the felicity was due to the power of
what he has seen rather than what he has read.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The first important life of Cowper was by Hayley
in 1803. In its complete form it appeared in 4 volumes in 1806 and
was reprinted in 1809 and 1812. It was reprinted again by the Rev.
T. S. Grimshawe with the Correspondence in 8 volumes in 1835.
Robert Southey&rsquo;s much more valuable <i>Life and Letters</i> appeared
also in 15 volumes in 1834-1837. The <i>Private Correspondence</i>, edited
by John Johnson, appeared in 2 volumes in 1824 and again in 1835.
The <i>Complete Correspondence</i>, edited by Thomas Wright, was published
in 1904, but more correspondence appeared in <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, July, August and September 1904, and in <i>The Poems of
William Cowper</i>, edited by J. C. Bailey (1905). Edward Dowden
unearthed new correspondence with William Hayley in <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i> (1907). Short lives of Cowper have appeared in many
quarters, from Thomas Taylor&rsquo;s (1833) to Goldwin Smith&rsquo;s in the
&ldquo;English Men of Letters&rdquo; series (1880). Another brief biography
of great merit is attached to the Globe edition of Cowper&rsquo;s <i>Works</i>.
Essays by Leslie Stephen, Stopford Brooke, Whitwell Elwin, George
Eliot and Walter Bagehot deserve attention. See also St Beuve&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">COWRY,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> the popular name of the shells of the <i>Cypraeida</i>, a
family of mollusks. Upwards of 100 species are recognized,
and they are widely distributed over the world&mdash;their habitat
being the shallow water along the sea-shore. The best known
is the money cowry or <i>Cypraea moneta</i>, a small shell about half
an inch in length, white and straw-coloured without and blue
within, which derives its distinctive name from the fact that in
various countries it has been employed as a kind of currency.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Shell-money</a></span>.) In Africa among those tribes, such as the
Niam-Niam, who do not recognize their monetary value, the
shells are in demand as fashionable decorations, just as in
Germany they were in use as an ornament for horses&rsquo; harness, and
were popular enough to acquire several native names, such as
<i>Brustharnisch</i> or breastplates, and <i>Otterköpfchen</i> or little adders&rsquo;
heads. Besides the <i>Cypraea moneta</i> various species are employed
in this decorative use. The <i>Cypraea aurora</i> is a mark of chieftainship
among the natives of the Friendly Islands; the <i>Cypraea
annulus</i> is a favourite with the Asiatic islanders; and several of
the larger kinds have been used in Europe for the carving of
cameos. The tiger cowry, <i>Cypraea tigris</i>, so well known as a

and they have also an ingenious plan of cementing portions of
several shells into a smooth oval ball which they then employ as a
bait to catch the cuttle-fish. While the species already mentioned
occur in myriads in their respective habitats, the <i>Cypraea princeps</i>
and the <i>Cypraea umbilicata</i> are extremely rare.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COX, DAVID<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1783-1859), English painter, was born on the
29th of April 1783, in a small house attached to the forge of his
father, a hardworking master smith, in a mean suburb of Birmingham.
Turning his hand to what he could get to do, Joseph Cox,
the father, was both blacksmith and whitesmith, and when the
war with France began took to the making of bayonets and horse
shoes, on wholesale commission, and immediately the boy David
was thought able to assist he was taken from the poor elementary
school in the neighbourhood, and set to the anvil. The attempt
to turn the boy to this kind of labour had, however, been made
too early; it was too heavy for his strength, and he was sent to
what was called by the cyclops of Birmingham a &ldquo;toy trade,&rdquo;
making lacquered buckles, painted lockets, tin snuff-boxes and
other &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; articles. Here David very soon acquired some
power of painting miniatures, and his talents might have been
misdirected had his master, Fieldler by name, not released him
from his apprenticeship by dying by his own hand; and David
found an opening as colour-grinder and scene-painter&rsquo;s fag in the
theatre then leased, with several others, by the father of
Macready, the tragedian.</p>

<p>This obscure step, not one of promotion at the time, was really
the most important incident in the uneventful career of Cox.
The boy, who had inherited a rather weakly body, and had been
trained with care by a pious mother, while intellectually negative
and unable to cope with any kind of learning whatever, had
endless perseverance, great strength of application, and all
through life remained genial, gentle, simple-minded and modest,
his penetration and self-reliance being wholly professional,
inspired by his love of nature and his knowledge of his subject.
Not very quick, and with little versatility, he went step by step
in one line of study from the time he began to get the smallest
remuneration for his pictures to the age of seventy-five, when he
painted large in oil very much the same class of subjects he had
of old produced small in water-colours, with the same impressive
and unaffectedly noble sentiment, only increased by the mastery
of almost infinite practice. He was never led astray by fictitious
splendour of any kind, except once indeed in 1825, when he
imitated Turner, and produced a classic subject he called
&ldquo;Carthage, Aeneas, and Achates.&rdquo; He never visited Venice or
Egypt, or crossed the Channel except for a week or two in
Belgium and Paris, and never even went to Scotland for painting
purposes. Bettws-y-Coed and its neighbourhood was everything
to him, and characteristics most truly English were beloved by
him with a sort of filial instinct. So completely did he love the
country, that even London, where it was his interest to live, had
few attractions, and did not retain him long.</p>

<p>This residence in the metropolis which began in 1804 was,
however, of the most essential educational advantage to him.
The Water-Colour Society was established the year after he
arrived, and was mainly supported by landscape-painters. He
was not, of course, admitted at first into membership, not till 1813,
before which time an attempt to establish a rival exhibition had
been made. In this Cox joined, the result being very serious to
him, an entire failure entailing the seizure and forced sale of all
the pictures. At that time the tightest economy was the rule
with him, and to save the trifling cost of new strainers or stretching
boards, he covered up one picture by another. When these
works were prepared for re-sale, fifty years afterwards, some of
them yielded picture after picture, peeled off the boards like the
waistcoats from the body of the gravedigger in Hamlet!</p>

<p>While lodging near Astley&rsquo;s Circus he married his landlady&rsquo;s
daughter, and then took a modest cottage at Dulwich, where he
gradually left off scene-painting and became teacher, giving
lessons at ten shillings a lesson. This entailed walking to the
pupils&rsquo; homes, and the gift of the paintings done before the pupils.
These have since been frequently sold for large sums, but his own
price, when lucky enough to sell his best works, was never over
a few pounds, and more frequently about fifteen shillings.
Sometimes, indeed, he sold them in quantities at two pounds a
dozen to be resold to country teachers. By and by he resisted the
leaving of the work done to the pupil, but with little advantage
to himself, as he saw no end to the accumulation of his own
productions, and actually tore them up, and threw them into
areas, or pushed them into drains during his trudge homeward.
A number of years after he pointed out a particular drain to a
friend, and said, &ldquo;Many a work of mine has gone down that way
to the Thames!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after he had turned thirty, his stay in London suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
ended. He was offered the enormous sum of £100 per annum,
by a ladies&rsquo; college in Hereford, and thither he went. This sum he
supplemented by teaching in the Hereford grammar school for
many years, at six guineas a year, and in other schools at better
pay, but still, and up to his fortieth year, we find his prices for
pictures from eight to twenty-five shillings. Cox has no history
apart from his productions, and these particulars as to his
remuneration possess an interest almost dramatic when we
contrast them with the enormous sums realized by his later
works, and with the &ldquo;honours and observance, troops of friends,&rdquo;
that accompanied old age with him, when settled down in his own
home at Harborne, near his native town, where he died on the
7th of June 1859.</p>

<p>Cox&rsquo;s second short residence in London, dating from 1835 to
1840, marks the period of his highest powers. During those
years, and for twelve years after, his productiveness kept pace
with his mastery, and it would be difficult to overrate the
impressiveness of effect, and high feeling, within the narrow range
of subject displayed by many of these works. He was now
surrounded by dealers, and wealth flowed in upon him. Still he
remained the same, a man with few wants and scarcely any
enjoyments except those furnished by his brush and his colours.
The home at Harborne was a pleasant one, but the approach to
the front was useless as the door was kept fastened up, the only
entrance being through the garden at the back, and the principal
room appropriated as his studio he was content to reach by a
narrow stair from the kitchen. Neither in it nor elsewhere was
there any luxury or even taste visible:&mdash;no <i>bric-à-brac</i>, no
objects of interest, few or no books, no pictures except landscapes
by his friends. When in winter, after his wife&rsquo;s death, the fire
went out, and the cold at last surprised him, he lifted his easel
into the little dining-room and began again. A union of his friends
was formed in 1855 to procure a portrait of him, which was
painted by Sir J. Watson Gordon; and an exhibition of his works
was opened in London in 1858 and again another in 1859. This
was actually open when the news of his death arrived.</p>

<p>The number of David Cox&rsquo;s works, great and small, is enormous.
He produced hundreds annually for perhaps forty-five years.
Before his death and for ten years thereafter, their prices were
remarkable, as witness the following obtained at auction&mdash;&ldquo;Going
to the Mill,&rdquo; £1575; &ldquo;Old Mill at Bettws-y-Coed,&rdquo;
£1575; &ldquo;Outskirts of a Wood, with Gipsies,&rdquo; £2305; &ldquo;Peace
and War,&rdquo; £3430.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COX, SIR GEORGE WILLIAM<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1827-1902), English divine
and scholar, was born on the 10th of January 1827, at Benares,
India, and was educated at Rugby and Trinity College, Oxford.
In 1850 he was ordained, and in 1860 took a mastership at
Cheltenham College, which he held for only a year. He had
already contributed to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and had published
in 1850 <i>Poems, Legendary and Historical</i> (with E. A. Freeman),
and in 1853 a <i>Life of St Boniface</i>. From 1861 he devoted himself
entirely to literary work, chiefly in connexion with history and
comparative mythology. Many of his works were avowedly
popular in character, and the most important, the <i>History of
Greece</i>, has been superseded and is now of little value. His
studies in mythology were inspired by Max Müller, but his
treatment of the subjects was his own. He was an extreme
supporter of the solar and nebular theory as the explanation of
myths. He also edited (with W. T. Brande) <i>A Dictionary of
Science, Literature and Art</i> (1875). Sir George Cox (who succeeded
to the baronetcy in 1877) was a Broad Churchman, and a
prominent supporter of Bishop Colenso in 1863-1865; and five
years after Colenso&rsquo;s death he published (1888) his <i>Life</i> of the
bishop. He was himself nominated to the see of Natal, but was
refused consecration. In 1881 he was made vicar of Scrayingham,
York, but resigned the living in 1897. In 1896 he was given a
civil list pension. He died at Walmer on the 9th of February
1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COX, JACOB DOLSON<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1828-1900), American general, political
leader and educationalist, was born on the 27th of October 1828
in Montreal, Canada. His father, a shipbuilder of German
descent (Koch), and his mother, a descendant of William Brewster,
were natives of New York City, where the boy grew up, studying
law in an office in 1842-1844, and working in a broker&rsquo;s office in
1844-1846, and where, under the influence of Charles G. Finney
(1792-1875), whose daughter he afterwards married, he prepared
himself for the ministry. He graduated at Oberlin College in
1851, having in the meantime given up his theological studies in
rebellion at Finney&rsquo;s dogmatism. In 1851-1853 he was superintendent
of schools at Warren, Ohio; in 1853 was admitted
to the Ohio bar, being at that time an anti-slavery Whig; and in
1859 was elected to the state senate, in which with Garfield and
James Monroe (1821-1898) he formed the &ldquo;Radical Triumvirate,&rdquo;
Cox himself presenting a petition for a personal liberty law and
urging woman&rsquo;s rights, especially larger property rights to married
women. Appointed by Governor Dennison one of three brigadiers-general
of militia in 1860, he eagerly undertook the study of
tactics, strategy and military history. He rendered great
assistance in raising troops for the Union service in 1861, enlisted
himself in spite of poor health and a family of six small children,
and in April was commissioned a brigadier-general, U.S.V. He
took part in the West Virginia campaign of 1861, served in the
Kanawha region, in supreme command after Rosecrans&rsquo;s relief
in the spring, until August 1862, when his troops were ordered to
join Burnside&rsquo;s 9th Corps in Virginia. After the death at his
side of General Reno in the battle of South Mountain, and during
Antietam, Cox commanded the corps, and at the close of the
campaign (6th Oct. 1862) he was appointed major-general,
U.S.V., but the appointment was not confirmed. In April-December
1863 he was head of the department of Ohio. In
1864 he took part in the Atlanta campaign under Sherman, as a
divisional and subsequently corps-commander: at the battle
of Franklin he commanded the 23rd Corps, and he served at
Nashville also. He led an expedition following Sherman into
the Carolinas and fought two successful actions with Bragg at
Kinston, N.C. He was governor of Ohio in 1866-1867, and as
such advocated the colonization of the freedmen in a restricted
area, and sympathized with President Johnson&rsquo;s programme of
Reconstruction and worked for a compromise between Johnson
and his opponents, although he finally deserted Johnson. In
1868 he was chairman of the Republican national convention
which nominated Grant. He was secretary of the interior in
1869-1870; opposed the confirmation of the treaty for the
annexation of Santo Domingo, negotiated by O. E. Babcock
and urged by President Grant; introduced the merit system
in his department, and resigned in October 1870 because of
pressure put on him by politicians piqued at his prohibition of
campaign levies on his clerks, and because of the interference
of Grant in favour of William McGarrahan&rsquo;s attempt by legal
proceedings to obtain from Cox a patent to certain California
mining lands. He took up legal practice in Cincinnati, became
president in 1873, and until 1877 was receiver, of the Toledo
&amp; Wabash &amp; Western. In 1877-1879 he was a representative in
Congress. From 1881 to 1897 he was dean of the Cincinnati
law school, and from 1885 to 1889 president of the University of
Cincinnati. He died at Magnolia, Massachusetts, on the 4th
of August 1900. A successful lawyer, and in his later years a
prominent microscopist, who won a gold medal of honour for
microphotography at the Antwerp Exposition of 1891, he is
best known as one of the greatest &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; generals of the
Civil War, and, with the possible exception of J. C. Ropes, the
highest American authority of his time on military history,
particularly the history of the American Civil War. He wrote
<i>Atlanta</i> (New York, 1882) and <i>The March to the Sea, Franklin
and Nashville</i> (New York, 1882), both in the series <i>Campaigns
of the Civil War</i>; <i>The Second Battle of Bull Run, as Connected

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COX, KENYON<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (1856-&emsp;&emsp;), American painter, was born at
Warren, Ohio, on the 27th of October 1856, being the son of
Gen. Jacob Dolson Cox. He was a pupil of Carolus-Duran and
of J. L. Gérôme in Paris from 1877 to 1882, when he opened a
studio in New York, subsequently teaching with much success
in the Art Students&rsquo; League. His earlier work was mainly of
the nude drawn with great academic correctness in somewhat
conventional colour. Receiving little encouragement for such
pictures, he turned to mural decorative work, in which he achieved
prominence. Among his better-known examples are the frieze
for the court room of the Appellate Court, New York, and decorations
for the Walker Art Gallery, Bowdoin College; for the
Capitol at Saint Paul, Minnesota, and for other public and private
buildings. He wrote with much authority on art topics, and is
the author of the critical reviews, <i>Old Masters and New</i> (1905)
and <i>Painters and Sculptors</i> (1907), besides some poems. He
became a National Academician in 1903. His wife, <i>née</i> Louise
H. King (b. 1865), whom he married in 1892, also became a
figure and portrait-painter of note.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COX, RICHARD<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (1500?-1581), dean of Westminster and
bishop of Ely, was born of obscure parentage at Whaddon,
Buckinghamshire, in 1499 or 1500. He was educated at the
Benedictine priory of St Leonard Snelshall near Whaddon, at
Eton, and at King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated
B.A. in 1524. At Wolsey&rsquo;s invitation he became a member of
the cardinal&rsquo;s new foundation at Oxford, was incorporated B.A.
in 1525, and created M.A. in 1526. In 1530 he was engaged in
persuading the more unruly members of the university to approve
of the king&rsquo;s divorce. A premature expression of Lutheran
views is said to have caused his departure from Oxford and even
his imprisonment, but the records are silent on these sufferings
which do not harmonize with his appointment as master of the
royal foundation at Eton. In 1533 he appears as author of an
ode on the coronation of Anne Boleyn, in 1535 he graduated B.D.
at Cambridge, proceeding D.D. in 1537, and in the same year
subscribing the Institution of a Christian Man. In 1540 he was
one of the fifteen divines to whom were referred crucial questions
on the sacraments and the seat of authority in the Church; his
answers (printed in Pocock&rsquo;s <i>Burnet</i>, iii. 443-496) indicate a
mind tending away from Catholicism, but susceptible to &ldquo;the
king&rsquo;s doctrine&rdquo;; and, indeed, Cox was one of the divines by
whom Henry said the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Book&rdquo; had been drawn up when
he wished to impress upon the Regent Arran that it was not
exclusively his own doing. Moreover, he was present at the
examination of Barnes, subscribed the divorce of Anne of Cleves,
and in that year of reaction became archdeacon and prebendary
of Ely and canon of Westminster. He was employed on other
royal business in 1541, was nominated to the projected bishopric
of Southwell, and was made king&rsquo;s chaplain in 1542. In 1543
he was employed to ferret out the &ldquo;Prebendaries&rsquo; Plot&rdquo; against
Cranmer, and became the archbishop&rsquo;s chancellor. In December
he was appointed dean of Oseney (afterwards Christ Church)
Oxford, and in July was made almoner to Prince Edward, in
whose education he took an active part. He was present at
Dr Crome&rsquo;s recantation in 1546, denounced it as insincere and
insufficient, and severely handled him before the privy council.</p>

<p>After Edward&rsquo;s accession, Cox&rsquo;s opinions took a more Protestant
turn, and he became one of the most active agents of
the Reformation. He was consulted on the compilation of the
Communion office in 1548, and the first and second books of
Common Prayer, and sat on the commission for the reform of the
canon law. As chancellor of the university of Oxford (1547-1552)
he promoted foreign divines such as Peter Martyr, and was
a moving spirit of the two commissions which sought with some
success to eradicate everything savouring of popery from the
books, MSS., ornaments and endowments of the university, and
earned Cox the sobriquet of its cancellor rather than its chancellor.
He received other rewards, a canonry of Windsor (1548),
the rectory of Harrow (1547) and the deanery of Westminster
(1549). He lost these preferments on Mary&rsquo;s accession, and was for
a fortnight in August 1553 confined to the Marshalsea. He was
not of the stuff of which martyrs are made; he remained in
obscurity until after the failure of Wyatt&rsquo;s rebellion, and then in
May 1554 escaped in the same ship as the future archbishop
Sandys, to Antwerp. Thence in March 1555 he made his way to
Frankfort, where he played an important part in the first struggle
between Anglicanism and Puritanism. The exiles had, under the
influence of Knox and Whittingham, adopted Calvinistic doctrine
and a form of service far more Puritanical than the Prayer-Book
of 1552. Cox stood up for that service, and the exiles were divided
into Knoxians and Coxians. Knox attacked Cox as a pluralist,
Cox accused Knox of treason to the emperor Charles V. This
proved the more dangerous charge: Knox and his followers
were expelled, and the Prayer-Book of 1552 was restored.</p>

<p>In 1559 Cox returned to England, and was elected bishop of
Norwich, but the queen changed her mind and Cox&rsquo;s destination
to Ely, where he remained twenty-one years. He was an honest,
but narrow-minded ecclesiastic, who held what views he did hold
intolerantly, and was always wanting more power to constrain
those who differed from him (see his letter in <i>Hatfield MSS.</i> i.
308). While he refused to minister in the queen&rsquo;s chapel because
of the crucifix and lights there, and was a bitter enemy to the
Roman Catholics, he had little more patience with the Puritans.
He was grasping, or at least tenacious of his rights in money
matters, and was often brought into conflict with courtiers who
coveted episcopal lands. The queen herself intervened, when he
refused to grant Ely House to her favourite, Sir Christopher
Hatton; but the well-known letter beginning &ldquo;Proud Prelate&rdquo;
and threatening to unfrock him seems to be an impudent forgery
which first saw the light in the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1761. It
hardly, however, misrepresents the queen&rsquo;s meaning, and Cox
was forced to give way. These and other trials led him to
resign his see in 1580, and it is significant that it remained vacant
for nineteen years. Cox died on the 22nd of July 1581: a
monument erected to his memory twenty years later in Ely
cathedral was defaced, owing, it was said, to his evil repute.
Strype (Whitgift, i. 2) gives Cox&rsquo;s hot temper and marriage as
reasons why he was not made archbishop in 1583 in preference to
Whitgift, who had been his chaplain; but Cox had been dead two
years in 1583. His first wife&rsquo;s name is unknown; she was the
mother of his five children, of whom Joanna married the eldest
son of Archbishop Parker. His second wife was the widow of
William Turner (d. 1568), the botanist and dean of Wells.</p>

was born in London on the 19th of April 1826. For some years
he worked as an apprentice in the London docks, and then
entered the Baptist College at Stepney. In 1851 he became
pastor of a Baptist church at Southsea, removing in 1855 to Ryde,
and in 1863 to Nottingham. He was president of the Baptist
Association in 1873 and received the degree of D.D. from St
Andrews in 1882. Cox had distinct gifts as a biblical expositor
and was the founder and first editor of a monthly journal <i>The
Expositor</i> (1875-1884). Among the best known of his numerous
theological publications are <i>Salvator Mundi</i> (1877), <i>A Commentary
on the Book of Job</i> (1880), <i>The Larger Hope</i> (1883).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COX, SAMUEL HANSON<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1793-1880), American Presbyterian
divine, was born at Rahway, N.J., on the 25th of August 1793,
of Quaker stock. He was pastor of the Presbyterian church at
Mendham, N.J., in 1817-1821, and of two churches in New York
from 1821 to 1834. He helped to found the University of the
City of New York, and from 1834 to 1837 was professor of pastoral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
theology at Auburn. The next seventeen years were passed in
active ministry at Brooklyn, whence in 1854, owing to a throat
affection, he removed to Owego, N.Y. He died at Bronxville,
N.Y., on the 2nd of October 1880. Cox was a fine orator, and a
speech made in Exeter Hall in 1833, in which he put the responsibility
for slavery in America on the British government, made
a great impression. It was he who described the appellation
D.D. as a couple of &ldquo;semi-lunar fardels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Arthur Cleveland Coxe</span> (1818-1896), who changed
the spelling of the family name, graduated at the University of
the City of New York in 1838 and at the General Theological
Seminary in 1841. He was rector of St John&rsquo;s Church, Hartford,
in 1843-1854, of Grace Church, Baltimore, in 1854-1863, and of
Calvary Church, New York City, in 1863. In 1863 he became
assistant bishop and in 1865 bishop of western New York. He
was strongly influenced by the Oxford Movement. Bishop Coxe
wrote spirited defences of Anglican orders and published several
volumes of verse, notably <i>Christian Ballads</i> (1845).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COXCIE, MICHAEL<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1499-1592), Flemish painter, was born at
Malines, and studied under Bernard van Orley, who probably
induced him to visit Italy. At Rome in 1532 he painted the
chapel of Cardinal Enckenvoort in the church of Santa Maria
dell&rsquo; Anima; and Vasari, who knew him, says with truth &ldquo;that he
fairly acquired the manner of an Italian.&rdquo; But Coxcie&rsquo;s principal
occupation was designing for engravers; and the fable of Psyche
in thirty-two sheets by Agostino Veneziano and the Master of the
Die are favourable specimens of his skill. During a subsequent
residence in the Netherlands Coxcie greatly extended his practice
in this branch of art. But his productions were till lately concealed
under an interlaced monogram M.C.O.K.X.I.N. Coxcie
returned in 1539 to Malines, where he matriculated, and painted
for the chapel of the gild of St Luke the wings of an altarpiece
now in Sanct Veit of Prague. The centre of this altarpiece,
by Mabuse, represents St Luke portraying the Virgin;
the side pieces contain the Martyrdom of St Vitus and the Vision
of St John in Patmos. At van Orley&rsquo;s death in 1541 Coxcie
succeeded to the office of court painter to the regent Mary of
Hungary, for whom he decorated the castle of Binche. He was
subsequently patronized by Charles V., who often coupled his
works with those of Titian; by Philip II., who paid him royally
for a copy of van Eyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agnus Dei&rdquo;; and by the duke of Alva,
who once protected him from the insults of Spanish soldiery at
Malines. There are large and capital works of his (1587-1588) in
St Rombaud of Malines, in Ste Gudule of Brussels, and in the
museums of Brussels and Antwerp. His style is Raphaelesque
grafted on the Flemish, but his imitation of Raphael, whilst it
distantly recalls Giulio Romano, is never free from affectation
and stiffness. He died at Malines on the 5th of March 1592.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COXE, HENRY OCTAVIUS<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1811-1881), English librarian and
scholar, was born at Bucklebury, in Berkshire, on the 20th of
September 1811. He was educated at Westminster school and
Worcester College, Oxford. Immediately on taking his degree in
1833, he began work in the manuscript department of the British
Museum, became in 1838 sub-librarian of the Bodleian, at Oxford,
and in 1860 succeeded Dr Bandinel as head librarian, an office he
held until his death in 1881. Having proved himself an able
palaeographer, he was sent out by the British government in
1857 to inspect the libraries in the monasteries of the Levant.
He discovered some valuable manuscripts, but the monks were
too wise to part with their treasures. One valuable result of his
travels was the detection of the forgery attempted by Constantine
Simonides. He was the author of various catalogues, and under
his direction that of the Bodleian, in more than 720 volumes, was
completed. He published <i>Rogeri de Wendover Chronica</i>, 5 vols.
(1841-1844); the <i>Black Prince, an historical poem written in
French by Chandos Herald</i> (1842); and <i>Report on the Greek
Manuscripts yet remaining in the Libraries of the Levant</i> (1858).
He was not only an accurate librarian but an active and hardworking
clergyman, and was for the last twenty-five years of his
life in charge of the parish of Wytham, near Oxford. He was
likewise honorary fellow of Worcester and Corpus Christi Colleges.
He died on the 8th of July 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COXE, WILLIAM<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (1747-1828), English historian, son of Dr
William Coxe, physician to the royal household, was born in
London on the 7th of March 1747. Educated at Marylebone
grammar school and at Eton College, he proceeded to King&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, and was elected a fellow of this society in
1768. In 1771 he took holy orders, and afterwards visited many
parts of Europe as tutor and travelling companion to various
noblemen and gentlemen. In 1786 he was appointed vicar of
Kingston-on-Thames, and in 1788 rector of Bemerton, Wiltshire.
He also held the rectory of Stourton from 1801 to 1811 and that
of Fovant from 1811 until his death. In 1791 he was made
prebendary of Salisbury, and in 1804 archdeacon of Wiltshire.
He married in 1803 Eleanora, daughter of William Shairp, consul-general
for Russia, and widow of Thomas Yeldham of St Petersburg.
He died on the 8th of June 1828.</p>

<p>During a long residence at Bemerton Coxe was mainly occupied
in literary work. His <i>Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole</i> (London,
1798), <i>Memoirs of Horatio, Lord Walpole</i> (London, 1802), <i>Memoirs
of John, duke of Marlborough</i> (London, 1818-1819), <i>Private and
Original Correspondence of Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury</i>
(London, 1821), <i>Memoirs of the Administrations of Henry Pelham</i>
(London, 1829), are very valuable for the history of the 18th
century. His <i>History of the House of Austria</i> (London, 1807,
new ed. 1853 and 1873), and <i>Memoirs of the Bourbon Kings of
Spain</i> (London, 1813), give evidence of careful and painstaking
work on the part of the author. The style, however, as in all his
works, is remarkably dull. His other works are mainly accounts
of his travels: <i>Sketches of the Natural, Political and Civil State
of Switzerland</i> (London, 1779), <i>Account of the Russian Discoveries
between Asia and America</i> (London, 1780), <i>Account of Prisons
and Hospitals in Russia, Sweden and Denmark</i> (London, 1781),
<i>Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark</i> (London, 1784),
<i>Travels in Switzerland</i> (London, 1789), <i>Letter on Secret Tribunals
of Westphalia</i> (London, 1796), <i>Historical Tour in Monmouthshire</i>
(London, 1801). He also edited Gay&rsquo;s <i>Fables</i>, and wrote a <i>Life
of John Gay</i> (Salisbury, 1797), <i>Anecdotes of G. F. Handel and
J. C. Smith</i> (London, 1798), and a few other works of minor
importance. Some of his books have been translated into
French, and several have gone through two or more editions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COXWELL, HENRY TRACEY<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1819-1900), English aeronaut,
was born at Wouldham, Kent, on the 2nd of March 1819, the
son of a naval officer. He was educated for the army, but
became a dentist. From a boy he had been greatly interested
in ballooning, then in its infancy, but his own first ascent was not
made until 1844. In 1848 he became a professional aeronaut,
making numerous public ascents in the chief continental cities.
Returning to London, he gave exhibitions from the Cremorne
and subsequently from the Surrey Gardens. By 1861 he had
made over 400 ascents. In 1862 in company with Dr James
Glaisher, he attained the greatest height on record, about
7 m. His companion became insensible, and he himself,
unable to use his frost-bitten hands, opened the gas-valve with
his teeth, and made an extremely rapid but safe descent. The
result of this and other aerial voyages by Coxwell and Glaisher
was the making of some important contributions to the science
of meteorology. Coxwell was most pertinacious in urging the
practical utility of employing balloons in time of war. He says:
&ldquo;I had hammered away in <i>The Times</i> for little less than a decade
before there was a real military trial of ballooning for military
purposes at Aldershot.&rdquo; His last ascent was made in 1885, and
he died on the 5th of January 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COYOTE,<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> the Indian name for a North American member of
the dog family, also known as the prairie-wolf, and scientifically
as <i>Canis latrans</i>. Ranging from Canada in the north to Guatemala
in the south, and chiefly frequenting the open plains on both
sides of the chain of the Rocky Mountains, the coyote, under all
its various local phases, is a smaller animal than the true wolf,
and may apparently be regarded as the New World representative
of the jackals, or perhaps, like the Indian wolf (<i>C.
pallipes</i>), as a type intermediate between wolves and jackals.
In addition to its inferior size, the coyote is also shorter in the
leg than the wolf, and carries a more luxuriant coat of hair.
The average length is about 40 in., and the general tone of
colour tawny mingled with black and white above and whitish
below, the tail having a black tip and likewise a dark gland-patch
near the root of the upper surface. There is, however,
considerable local variation both in the matter of size and
of colour from the typical coyote of Iowa, which measures
about 50 in. in total length and is of a full rich tint. The
coyote of the deserts of eastern California, Nevada and Utah
is, for instance, a smaller and paler-coloured animal, whose
length is usually about 42 in. On this and other local variations
a number of nominal species have been founded; but
it is preferable to regard them in the light of geographical phases
or races, such as the above-mentioned <i>C. latrans estor</i> of Nevada
and Utah, <i>C. l. mearnsi</i> of Arizona and Sonora, and <i>C. l. frustor</i>
of Oklahoma and the Arkansas River district.</p>

<p>It is to distinguish them from the grey, or timber, wolves that
coyotes have received the name of &ldquo;prairie-wolves&rdquo;; the two
titles indicating the nature of the respective habitats of the two
species. Coyotes are creatures of slinking and stealthy habits,
living in burrows in the plains, and hunting in packs at night,
when they utter yapping cries and blood-curdling yells as they
gallop. Hares (&ldquo;jack-rabbits&rdquo;), chipmunks or ground-squirrels,
and mice form a large portion of their food; but coyotes also
kill the fawns of deer and prongbuck, as well as sage-hens and
other kinds of game-birds. &ldquo;In the flat lands,&rdquo; write Messrs
Witmer Stone and W. E. Cram, in their <i>American Animals</i>
(1902), &ldquo;they dig burrows for themselves or else take possession
of those already made by badgers and prairie-dogs. Here in the
spring the half-dozen or more coyote pups are brought forth;
and it is said that at this season the old ones systematically
drive any large game they may be chasing as near to their burrow,
where the young coyotes are waiting to be fed, as possible before
killing it, in order to save the labour of dragging it any great
distance. When out after jack-rabbits two coyotes usually
work together. When a jack-rabbit starts up before them, one
of the coyotes bounds away in pursuit while the other squats
on his haunches and waits his turn, knowing full well that the
hare prefers to run in a circle, and will soon come round again,
when the second wolf takes up the chase and the other rests in
his turn.... When hunting antelope (prongbuck) and deer
the coyotes spread out their pack into a wide circle, endeavouring
to surround their game and keep it running inside their ring
until exhausted. Sage-hens, grouse and small birds the coyote
hunts successfully alone, quartering over the ground like a trained
pointer until he succeeds in locating his bird, when he drops
flat in the grass and creeps forward like a cat until close enough
for the final spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When hard put to it for food, coyotes will, it is reported, eat
hips, juniper-berries and other wild fruits.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COYPEL,<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> the name of a French family of painters. Noel
Coypel (1628-1707), also called, from the fact that he was much
influenced by Poussin, <span class="sc">Coypel le Poussin</span>, was the son of an
unsuccessful artist. Having been employed by Charles Errard to
paint some of the pictures required for the Louvre, and having
afterwards gained considerable fame by other pictures produced
at the command of the king, in 1672 he was appointed director
of the French Academy at Rome. After four years he returned to
France; and not long after he became director of the Academy
of Painting. The Martyrdom of St James in Notre Dame is
perhaps his finest work.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Antoine Coypel</span> (1661-1772), was still more celebrated
than his father. Antoine studied under his father, with whom
he spent four years at Rome. At the age of eighteen he was
admitted into the Academy of Painting, of which he became
professor and rector in 1707, and director in 1714. In 1716 he
was appointed king&rsquo;s painter, and he was ennobled in the following
year. Antoine Coypel received a careful literary education,
the effects of which appear in his works; but the graceful
imagination displayed by his pictures is marred by the fact that
he was not superior to the artificial taste of his age. He was a
clever etcher, and engraved several of his own works. His
<i>Discours prononcés dans les conférences de l&rsquo; Académie royale de
Peinture, &amp;c.</i>; appeared in 1741.</p>

<p>Antoine&rsquo;s half-brother, <span class="sc">Noel Nicholas Coypel</span> (1692-1734),
was also an exceedingly popular artist; and his son, Charles
Antoine (1694-1752), was painter to the king and director
of the Academy of Painting. The latter published interesting
academical lectures in <i>Le Mercure</i> and wrote several plays which
were acted at court, but were never published.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COYPU,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> the native name of a large South American aquatic
rodent mammal, known very generally among European residents
in the country as nutria (the Spanish word for otter) and scientifically
as <i>Myocastor</i> (or <i>Myopotamus</i>) <i>coypu</i>. Its large size,
aquatic habits, partially webbed hind-toes, and the smooth,
broad, orange-coloured incisors, are sufficient to distinguish
this rodent from the other members of the family <i>Capromyidae</i>.
Coypu are abundant in the fresh waters of South America, even
small ponds being often tenanted by one or more pairs. Should
the water dry up, the coypu seek fresh homes. Although
subsisting to a considerable extent on aquatic plants, these
rodents frequently come ashore to feed, especially in the evening.
Several young are produced at a birth, which are carried on their
mother&rsquo;s back when swimming. The fur is of some commercial
value, although rather stiff and harsh; its colour being reddish-brown.

<p><span class="bold">COYSEVOX, CHARLES ANTOINE<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1640-1720), French
sculptor, was born at Lyons on the 29th of September 1640, and
belonged to a family which had emigrated from Spain. The
name should be pronounced Coëzevo. He was only seventeen
when he produced a statue of the Madonna of considerable
merit; and having studied under Lerambert and trained himself
by taking copies in marble from the Greek masterpieces (among
others from the Venus de Medici and the Castor and Pollux), he
was engaged by the bishop of Strassburg, Cardinal Fürstenberg,
to adorn with statuary his château at Saverne (Zabern). In
1666 he married Marguerite Quillerier, Lerambert&rsquo;s niece, who
died a year after the marriage. In 1671, after four years spent
on Saverne, which was subsequently destroyed by fire in 1780,
he returned to Paris. In 1676 his bust of the painter Le Brun
obtained admission for him to the Académie Royale. A year
later he married Claude Bourdict.</p>

<p>In consequence of the influence exercised by Le Brun between
the years 1677 and 1685, he was employed by Louis XIV.
in producing much of the decoration and a large number of
statues for Versailles; and he afterwards worked, between 1701
and 1709, with no less facility and success, for the palace at
Marly, subsequently destroyed in the Revolution.</p>

<p>Among his works are the &ldquo;Mercury and Fame,&rdquo; first at Marly
and afterwards in the gardens of the Tuileries; &ldquo;Neptune and
Amphitrite,&rdquo; in the gardens at Marly; &ldquo;Justice and Force,&rdquo; at
Versailles; and statues, in which the likenesses are said to have
been remarkably successful, of most of the celebrated men of his
age, including Louis XIV. and Louis XV. at Versailles, Colbert
(at Saint-Eustache), Mazarin (in the church des Quatre-Nations),
Condé the Great (in the Louvre), Maria Theresa of Austria,
Turenne, Vauban, Cardinals de Bouillon and de Polignac,
Fénelon, Racine, Bossuet (in the Louvre), the comte d&rsquo;Harcourt,
Cardinal Fürstenberg and Charles Le Brun (in the Louvre).
Coysevox died in Paris on the 10th of October 1720.</p>

<p>Besides the works given above he carved about a dozen
memorials, including those to Colbert (at Saint-Eustache), to
Cardinal Mazarin (in the Louvre), and to the painter Le Brun (in
the church of Saint Nicholas-du-Chardon).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAB<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Krabbe</i>, <i>Krebs</i>), a name applied to the Crustacea of
the order <i>Brachyura</i>, and to other forms, especially of the order
<i>Anomura</i>, which resemble them more or less closely in appearance
and habits.</p>

<p>The <i>Brachyura</i>, or true crabs, are distinguished from the long-tailed
lobsters and shrimps which form the order <i>Macrura</i>, by
the fact that the abdomen or tail is of small size and is carried
folded up under the body. In most of them the body is transversely
oval or triangular in outline and more or less flattened,
and is covered by a hard shell, the carapace. There are five
pairs of legs. The first pair end in nippers or chelae and are
usually much more massive than the others which are used in
walking or swimming. The eyes are set on movable stalks and
can be withdrawn into sockets in the front part of the carapace.
There are six pairs of jaws and foot-jaws (maxillipeds) enclosed
within a &ldquo;buccal cavern,&rdquo; the opening of which is covered by the
broad and flattened third pair of foot-jaws. The abdomen is
usually narrow and triangular in the males, but in the females it
is broad and rounded and bears appendages to which the eggs are
attached after spawning (fig. 1).</p>

<p>As in most Crustacea, the young of nearly all crabs, when
newly hatched, are very different from their parents. The first
larval stage is known
as a Zoëa, this name
having been given to it
when it was believed
by naturalists to be
a distinct and independent
species of
animal. The Zoëa is
a minute transparent
organism, swimming
at the surface of the
sea. It has a rounded
body, armed with
long spines, and a long
segmented tail. The
eyes are large but not
set on stalks, the legs
are not yet developed,
and the foot-jaws form
swimming paddles.
After casting its skin
several times as it
grows in size, the
young crab passes into
a stage known as the
<i>Megalopa</i> (fig. 2), also
formerly regarded as
an independent animal, in which the body and limbs are more
crab-like, but the abdomen is large and not filled up. After a
further moult the animal assumes a form very similar to that of
the adult. There are a few crabs, living on land or in fresh water,
which do not pass through a metamorphosis but leave the egg as
miniature adults.</p>

<p>Most crabs live in the sea, and even the land-crabs, which are
abundant in tropical countries, nearly all visit the sea occasionally
and pass through their early stages in it. Many shore-crabs
living between tide-marks are more or less amphibious, and the
river-crab of southern Europe or Lenten crab (<i>Potamon edule</i>,
better known as <i>Thelphusa fluviatilis</i>) is an example of the freshwater
crabs which are abundant in most of the warmer regions of
the world. As a rule, crabs breathe by gills, which are lodged in
a pair of cavities at the sides of the carapace, but in the true
land-crabs the cavities become enlarged and modified so as to act
as lungs for breathing air.</p>

<p>Walking or crawling is the usual mode of locomotion, and the
peculiar sidelong gait familiar to most people in the common
shore-crab, is characteristic of most members of the group. The
crabs of the family <i>Portunidae</i>, and some others, swim with
great dexterity by means of their flattened paddle-shaped
feet.</p>

<p>Like many other Crustacea, crabs are often omnivorous and
act as the scavengers of the sea, but many are predatory in their
habits and some are content with a vegetable diet.</p>

<p>Though no crab, perhaps, is truly parasitic, some live in
relations of &ldquo;commensalism&rdquo; with other animals. The best
known examples of this are the little &ldquo;mussel-crabs&rdquo; (<i>Pinnotheridae</i>)
which live within the shells of mussels and other bivalve
mollusca and probably share the food of their hosts. Some
crabs live among corals, and one species at least gives rise to
hollow swellings on the branches of a coral like the &ldquo;galls&rdquo;
which are formed on plants by certain insects. Another
crab (<i>Melia tesselata</i>) carries in each of its claws a living sea-anemone
which it uses as an animated weapon of defence and
an implement for the capture of prey. Many of the sluggish
spider-crabs (<i>Maiidae</i>) have their shells covered by a forest
of growing sea-weeds, zoophytes and sponges, which are
&ldquo;planted&rdquo; there by the crab itself, and which afford it a very
effective disguise.</p>

<p>Many of the larger crabs are sought for as food by man. The
most important and valuable are the edible crab of British
and European coasts (<i>Cancer pagurus</i>) and the blue crab of the
Atlantic coast of the United States (<i>Callinectes sapidus</i>).</p>

<p>Among the <i>Anomura</i>, the best known are the hermit-crabs,
which live in the empty shells of Gasteropod Mollusca, which
they carry about with them as portable dwellings. In these,
the abdomen is soft-skinned and spirally twisted so as to fit into
the shells which they inhabit. The common hermit-crab of the
British coasts (<i>Pagurus</i> or <i>Eupagurus Bernhardus</i>) is sometimes
called the soldier-crab from its pugnacity. Small specimens
are found between tide-marks inhabiting the shells of periwinkles
and other small molluscs, but the full-grown specimens live in
deeper water and are usually found in the shell of the whelk
(<i>Buccinum</i>). As the crab grows it changes its dwelling from
time to time, often having to fight with its fellows for the possession
of an empty shell. Sometimes an annelid worm lives
inside the shell along with the hermit and often the outside is
covered with zoophytes. In some species, as in the British
<i>Eupagurus prideauxi</i>, a sea-anemone is constantly found attached
to the shell, profiting by the active locomotion of the crab and
probably sharing the crumbs of its food, while it affords its host
protection by its stinging powers.</p>

<p>In tropical countries the hermit-crabs of the family <i>Coenobitidae</i>
live on land, often at considerable distances from the
sea, to which, however, they return for the purpose of hatching
out their spawn. The large robber-crab or cocoa-nut crab of
the Indo-Pacific islands (<i>Birgus latro</i>), which belongs to this
family, has given up the habit of carrying a portable dwelling,
and the upper surface of its abdomen has become covered by
shelly plates. The stories of its climbing palm-trees to get the
fruit were long doubted, but it has been seen, and even photographed
in the act.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRABBE, GEORGE<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1754-1832), English poet, was born at
Aldeburgh in Suffolk on the 24th of December 1754. His family
was partly of Norfolk, partly of Suffolk origin, and the name
was doubtless originally derived from &ldquo;crab.&rdquo; His grandfather,
Robert Crabbe, was the first of the family to settle at Aldeburgh,
where he held the appointment of collector of customs. He died
in 1734, leaving one son, George, who practised many occupations,
including that of a schoolmaster, in the adjoining village of
Orford. Finally the poet&rsquo;s father obtained a small post in the
customs of Aldeburgh, married Mary Lodwick, the widow of a
publican, and had six children, of whom George was the eldest.</p>

<p>The sea has swept away the small cottage that was George
Crabbe&rsquo;s birthplace, but one may still visit the quay at Slaughden,
some half-mile from the town, where the father worked and the
son was at a later date to work with him. At first attending
a dame&rsquo;s school in Aldeburgh, when nine or ten years of age he
was sent to a boarding-school at Bungay, and at twelve to a school
at Stowmarket, where he remained two years. His father dreamt
of the medical profession for his clever boy, and so in 1768 he
went to Wickham Brook near Newmarket as an apothecary&rsquo;s
assistant. In 1771 we find him assisting a surgeon at Woodbridge,
and it was while here that he met Sarah Elmy. Crabbe was now
only eighteen years of age, but he became &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; to this
lady in 1772. It was not until 1783 that the pair were married.
The intervening years were made up of painful struggle, in which,
however, not only the affection but the purse of his betrothed
assisted him. About the time of Crabbe&rsquo;s return from Woodbridge
to Aldeburgh he published at Ipswich his first work, a
poem entitled <i>Inebriety</i> (1775). He found his father fallen on
evil days. There was no money to assist him to a partnership,
and surgery for the moment seemed out of the question. For
a few weeks Crabbe worked as a common labourer, rolling butter
casks on Slaughden quay. Before the year was out, however,
the young man bought on credit &ldquo;the shattered furniture of an
apothecary&rsquo;s shop and the drugs that stocked it.&rdquo; This was at
Aldeburgh. A year later Crabbe installed a deputy in the
surgery and paid his first visit to London. He lodged in Whitechapel,
took lessons in midwifery and walked the hospitals.
Returning to Aldeburgh after nine months&mdash;in 1777&mdash;he found
his practice gone. Even as a doctor for the poor he was an utter
failure, poetry having probably taken too firm a hold upon his
mind. At times he suffered hunger, so utterly unable was he
to earn a livelihood. After three years of this, in 1780 Crabbe
paid his second visit to London, enabled thereto by the loan of
five pounds from Dudley Lang, a local magnate. This visit
to London, which was undertaken by sea on board the &ldquo;Unity&rdquo;
smack, made for Crabbe a successful career. His poem <i>The
Candidate</i>, issued soon after his arrival, helped not at all. For
a time he almost starved, and was only saved, it is clear, by gifts
of money from his sweetheart Sarah Elmy. He importuned
the great, and the publishers also. Everywhere he was refused,
but at length a letter which reached Edmund Burke in March
1781 led to the careful consideration on the part of that great
man of Crabbe&rsquo;s many manuscripts. Burke advised the publication
of <i>The Library</i>, which appeared in 1781. He invited him
to Beaconsfield, and made interest in the right quarters to secure
Crabbe&rsquo;s entry into the church. He was ordained in December
1781 and was appointed curate to the rector of Aldeburgh.</p>

<p>Crabbe was not happy in his new post. The Aldeburgh folk
could not reverence as priest a man they had known as a day
labourer. Crabbe again appealed to Burke, who persuaded the
duke of Rutland to make him his chaplain (1782), and Crabbe
took up his residence in Belvoir Castle, accompanying his new
patron to London, when Lord Chancellor Thurlow (who told
him he was &ldquo;as like Parson Adams as twelve to the dozen&rdquo;)
gave him the two livings of Frome St Quentin and Evershot in
Dorsetshire, worth together about £200 a year. In May 1783
Crabbe&rsquo;s poem <i>The Village</i> was published by Dodsley, and in
December of this year he married Sarah Elmy. Crabbe continued
his duties as ducal chaplain, being in the main a non-resident
priest so far as his Dorsetshire parishes were concerned. In
1785 he published <i>The Newspaper</i>. Shortly after this he moved
with his wife from Belvoir Castle to the parsonage of Stathern,
where he took the duties of the non-resident vicar Thomas Parke,
archdeacon of Stamford. Crabbe was at Stathern for four years.
In 1789, through the persuasion of the duchess of Rutland (now
a widow, the duke having died in Dublin as lord-lieutenant of
Ireland in 1787), Thurlow gave Crabbe the two livings of Muston
in Leicestershire and West Allington in Lincolnshire. At
Muston parsonage Crabbe resided for twelve years, divided by
a long interval. He had been four years at Muston when his
wife inherited certain interests in a property of her uncle&rsquo;s that
placed her and her husband in possession of Ducking Hall,
Parham, Suffolk. Here he took up his residence from 1793 to
1796, leaving curates in charge of his two livings. In 1796 the
loss of their son Edmund led the Crabbes to remove from Parham
to Great Glemham Hall, Suffolk, where they lived until 1801.
In that year Crabbe went to live at Rendham, a village in the
same neighbourhood. In 1805 he returned to Muston. In 1807
he broke a silence of more than twenty years by the publication
of <i>The Parish Register</i>, in 1810 of <i>The Borough</i>, and in 1812 of
<i>Tales in Verse</i>. In 1813 Crabbe&rsquo;s wife died, and in 1814 he was
given the living of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, by the duke of Rutland,
a son of his early patron, who, it is interesting to recall, wanted
the living of Muston for a cousin of Lord Byron. From 1814
to his death in 1832 Crabbe resided at Trowbridge.</p>

<p>These last years were the most prosperous of his life. He was
a constant visitor to London, and in friendship with all the
literary celebrities of the time. &ldquo;Crabbe seemed to grow young
again,&rdquo; remarks his biographer, M. René Huchon. He certainly
carried on a succession of mild flirtations, and one of his
parishioners, Charlotte Ridout, would have married him. The
elderly widower had proposed to her and had been accepted in
1814, but he drew out of the engagement in 1816. He proposed
to yet another friend, Elizabeth Charter, somewhat later. In
his visits to London Crabbe was the guest of Samuel Rogers, in
St James&rsquo;s Place, and was a frequent visitor to Holland House,
where he met his brother poets Moore and Campbell. In 1817
his <i>Tales of the Hall</i> were completed, and John Murray offered
£3000 for the copyright, Crabbe&rsquo;s previous works being included.
The offer after much negotiation was accepted, but Crabbe&rsquo;s
popularity was now on the wane.</p>

<p>In 1822 Crabbe went to Edinburgh on a visit to Sir Walter
Scott. The adventure, complicated as it was by the visit of
George IV. about the same time, is most amusingly described in
Lockhart&rsquo;s biography of Scott, although one episode&mdash;that of the
broken wine-glass&mdash;is discredited by Crabbe&rsquo;s biographer, M.
Huchon. Crabbe died at Trowbridge on the 3rd of February
1832, and was buried in Trowbridge church, where an ornate
monument was placed over his tomb in August 1833.</p>

<p>Never was any poet at the same time so great and continuous
a favourite with the critics, and yet so conspicuously allowed to
fall into oblivion by the public. All the poets of his earlier and
his later years, Cowper, Scott, Byron, Shelley in particular, have
been reprinted again and again. With Crabbe it was long quite
otherwise. His works were collected into eight volumes, the
first containing his life by his son, in 1832. The edition was
intended to continue with some of his prose writings, but the
reception of the eight volumes was not sufficiently encouraging.
A reprint, however, in one volume was made in 1847, and it has
been reproduced since in 1854, 1867 and 1901. The exhaustion of
the copyright, however, did no good for Crabbe&rsquo;s reputation, and
it was not until the end of the century that sundry volumes of
&ldquo;selections&rdquo; from his poems appeared; Edward FitzGerald, of
Omar Khayyám fame, always a loyal admirer, made a
&ldquo;Selection,&rdquo; privately printed by Quaritch, in 1879. A &ldquo;Selection&rdquo;
by Bernard Holland appeared in 1899, another by C. H.
Herford in 1902 and a third by Deane in 1903. The <i>Complete
Works</i> were published by the Cambridge University Press in
three volumes, edited by A. W. Ward, in 1906.</p>

<p>Crabbe&rsquo;s poems have been praised by many competent pens, by
Edward FitzGerald in his <i>Letters</i>, by Cardinal Newman in his
<i>Apologia</i>, and by Sir Leslie Stephen in his <i>Hours in a Library</i>,
most notably. His verses comforted the last hours of Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
James Fox and of Sir Walter Scott, while Thomas Hardy has
acknowledged their influence on the realism of his novels. But
his works have ceased to command a wide public interest. He
just failed of being the artist in words who is able to make the
same appeal in all ages. Yet to-day his poems will well repay
perusal. His stories are profoundly poignant and when once
read are never forgotten. He is one of the great realists of
English fiction, for even considered as a novelist he makes
fascinating reading. He is more than this: for there is true
poetry in Crabbe, although his most distinctively lyric note was
attained when he wrote under the influence of opium, to which he
became much addicted in his later years.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRACOW<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (Pol. <i>Krakov</i>; Ger. <i>Krakau</i>), a town and episcopal
see of Austria, in Galicia, 212 m. W. by N. of Lemberg by rail.
Pop. (1900) 91,310, of which 21,000 were Jews, 5000 Germans
and the remainder Poles. Although in regard to its population
it is only the second place in Galicia, Cracow is the most interesting
town in the whole of Poland. No other Polish town possesses
so many old and historic buildings, none of them contains so
many national relics, or has been so closely associated with
the development and destinies of Poland as Cracow. And the
ancient capital is still the intellectual centre of the Polish nation.</p>

<p>Cracow is situated in a fertile plain on the left bank of the
Vistula (which becomes navigable here) and occupies a position of
great strategical importance. It consists of the old inner town
and seven suburbs. The only relics of the fortifications of the
old town, whose place is now occupied by shady promenades, is
the Florian&rsquo;s Gate and the Rondell, a circular structure, built in
1498. Cracow has 39 churches&mdash;about half the number it
formerly had&mdash;and 25 convents for monks and nuns. Of these
the most important is the Stanislaus cathedral, in Gothic style,
consecrated in 1359, and built on the Wawel, the rocky eminence
to the S.W. of the old town. Here the kings of Poland were
crowned, and this church is also the Pantheon of the Polish
nation, the burial place of its kings and its great men. Here
lie the remains of John Sobieski, of Thaddaeus Kosciuszko, of
Joseph Poniatowski and of Adam Mickiewicz. Here also are
conserved the remains of St Stanislaus, the patron saint of the
Poles, who, as bishop of Cracow, was slain before the altar by
King Boleslaus in 1079. The cathedral is adorned with many
valuable objects of art, paintings and sculptures, by such artists
as Veit Stoss, Guido Reni, Peter Vischer, Thorwaldsen, &amp;c.
Part of the ancient Polish regalia is also kept here. The Gothic
church of St Mary, founded in 1223, rebuilt in the 14th century
with several chapels added in the 15th and 16th centuries, was
restored in 1889-1893, and decorated with paintings from the
designs by Matejko. It contains a huge high altar, the masterpiece
of Veit Stoss, who was a native of Cracow, executed in
1477-1489; a colossal stone crucifix, dating from the end of the
15th century, and several sumptuous tombs of noble families
from the 16th and 17th centuries. The Dominican church, a
Gothic building of the 13th century, but practically rebuilt after a
fire in 1850; the Franciscan church, also of the 13th century, also
much modernized; the church of St Florian of the 12th century,
rebuilt in 1768, which contains the late-Gothic altar by Veit
Stoss, executed in 1518, during his last sojourn in Cracow; the
church of St Peter, with a colossal dome, built in 1597, after the
model of that of St Peter at Rome, and the beautiful Augustinian
church in the suburb of Kazimierz, are all worth mentioning.
Of the principal secular buildings, the royal castle (<i>Zamek
Królowsk</i>), a huge building, begun in the 13th century, and
successively enlarged by Casimir the Great and by Sigismund I.
Jagiello (1510-1533), is situated on the Wawel, and was until
1610 the residence of the Polish kings. It suffered much from
fires and other disasters, and from 1846 onward was used as a
barracks and a military hospital; it has now, however, been
cleared out and restored. The Jagellonian university, now
housed in a magnificent Gothic building erected in 1881-1887,
was attended in 1901 by 1255 students, and had 175 professors
and lecturers. The language of instruction is Polish. It is the
second oldest university in Europe&mdash;the oldest being that of
Prague&mdash;and was famous during the 15th and 16th centuries.
It was founded by Casimir the Great in 1364, and completed by
Ladislaus Jagiello in 1400. Its rich library is now housed in the
old university buildings, erected in the 15th century, in the
beautiful Gothic court of which a bronze statue of Copernicus was
placed in 1900. The Polish Academy of Science, founded in 1872,
is housed in the new university buildings. In the Ring-Platz,
or the principal square, opposite the church of St Mary, is the
<i>Tuchhaus</i> (cloth-hall, Pol. <i>Sukiennice</i>), a building erected in 1257,
several times renovated and enlarged, most recently in 1879,
which contains the Polish national museum of art. Behind it is a
Gothic tower, the only relic of the old town hall, demolished in
1820. The Czartoryski museum contains a large collection of
objects of art, a rich library and a precious collection of manuscripts,
relating to the history of Poland.</p>

<p>Among the manufactures of the town are machinery, agricultural
implements, chemicals, soap, tobacco, &amp;c. But Cracow
is more important as a trading than as an industrial centre.
Its position on the Vistula and at the junction of several railways
makes it the natural mart for the exchange of the products of
Silesia, Hungary and Russian and Austrian Poland. Its trade
in timber, salt, textiles, cattle, wine and agricultural produce of
all kinds is very considerable. In the neighbourhood of Cracow
there are mines of coal and zinc, and not far away lies the village
of Krzeszowice with sulphur baths. About 2½ m. N.W. lies the
Kosciuszko Hill, a mound of earth 100 ft. high, thrown up in
1820-1823 on the Borislava hill (1093 ft.), in honour of Thaddaeus
Kosciuszko, the hero of Poland. On the opposite bank of the
Vistula, united to Cracow by a bridge, lies the town of Podgorze
(pop. 18,142); near it is the Krakus Hill, smaller than the
Kosciuszko Hill, and a thousand years older than it, erected in
honour of Krakus, the founder of Cracow. About 8 m. S.E. of
Cracow is situated Wieliczka (<i>q.v.</i>), with its famous salt mines.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Tradition assigns the foundation of Cracow to the
mythical Krak, a Polish prince who is said to have built a stronghold
here about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700. Its early history is, however, entirely
obscure. In the latter part of the 10th century it was annexed to
the Bohemian principality, but was recaptured by Boleslaus
Chrobry, who made it the seat of a bishopric, and it became the
capital of one of the most important of the principalities into
which Poland was divided from the 12th century onwards. The
city was practically ruined during the first Tatar invasion in
1241, but the introduction of German colonists restored its
prosperity, and in 1257 it received &ldquo;Magdeburg rights,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a
civic constitution modelled on that of Magdeburg. In this year
the <i>Tuchhalle</i> was built. The town, however, had yet to pass
through many vicissitudes. It suffered again from Tatar invasions;
in 1290 it was captured by Wenceslaus II. of Bohemia
and was held by the Bohemians until, in 1305, the Polish king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
Ladislaus Lokietek recovered it from Wenceslaus III. Ladislaus
made it his capital, and from this time until 1764 it remained
the coronation and burial place of the Polish kings, even after
the royal residence had been removed by Siegmund III. (1587-1632)
to Warsaw. On the third partition of Poland in 1795
Austria took possession of Cracow; but in 1809 Napoleon
wrested it from that power, and incorporated it with the duchy
of Warsaw, which was placed under the rule of the king of
Saxony. In the campaign of 1812 the emperor Alexander made
himself master of this and the other territory which formed the
duchy of Warsaw. At the general settlement of the affairs of
Europe by the great powers in 1815, it was agreed that Cracow
and the adjoining territory should be formed into a free state;
and, by the Final Act of the congress signed at Vienna in 1815,
&ldquo;the town of Cracow, with its territory, is declared to be for
ever a free, independent and strictly neutral city, under the
protection of Russia, Austria and Prussia.&rdquo; In February 1846,
however, an insurrection broke out in Cracow, apparently a
ramification of a widely spread conspiracy throughout Poland.
The senate and the other authorities of Cracow were unable to
subdue the rebels or to maintain order, and, at their request, the
city was occupied by a corps of Austrian troops for the protection
of the inhabitants. The three powers, Russia, Austria and
Prussia, made this a pretext for extinguishing this independent
state; and as the outcome of a conference at Vienna (November
1846) the three courts, contrary to the assurance previously
given, and in opposition to the expressed views of the British and
French governments, decided to extinguish the state of Cracow
and to incorporate it with the dominions of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRADDOCK, CHARLES EGBERT<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1850-&emsp;&emsp;), the pen-name
of <span class="sc">Mary Noailles Murfree</span>, American author, who was born
near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on the 24th of January 1850, the
great-granddaughter of Col. Hardy Murfree. She was crippled
in childhood by paralysis. She attended school in Nashville and
Philadelphia. Spending her summers in the mountains of eastern
Tennessee, she came to know the primitive people there with
whose life her writings deal. She contributed to <i>Appleton&rsquo;s
Journal</i>, and, first in 1878, to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. No one,
apparently, suspected that the author of these stories was a
woman, and her identity was not disclosed until 1885, a year
after the publication of her first volume of short stories, <i>In the
Tennessee Mountains</i>. She deals mainly with the narrow, stern
life of the Tennessee mountaineers, who, left behind in the advance
of civilization, live amid traditions and customs, and speak a
dialect, peculiarly their own; and her work abounds in exquisite
descriptions of scenery. Among her other books are: <i>Where
the Battle was Fought</i> (1884), a novel dealing with the old aristocratic
southern life; <i>Down the Ravine</i> (1885) and <i>The Story of
Keedon Bluffs</i> (1887) for young people; <i>The Prophet of the Great
Smoky Mountains</i> (1885), a novel; <i>In the Clouds</i> (1886), a novel;
<i>The Despot of Broomsedge Cove</i> (1888), a novel; <i>In the &ldquo;Stranger-People&rsquo;s&rdquo;

<i>The Story of Old Fort Loudon</i> (1899); <i>The Bushwhackers and
Other Stories</i> (1899); <i>The Champion</i> (1902); <i>A Spectre of Power</i>
(1903); <i>The Frontiersman</i> (1904); <i>The Storm Centre</i> (1905);

(1908).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRADLE<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (of uncertain etymology, possibly connected with
&ldquo;crate&rdquo; and &ldquo;creel,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> basket; the derivation from a Celtic
word, with a sense of rocking, is scouted by the <i>New English
Dictionary</i>), a child&rsquo;s bed of wood, wicker or iron, with enclosed
sides, slung upon pivots or mounted on rockers. It is a very
ancient piece of furniture, but the date when it first assumed
its characteristic swinging or rocking form is by no means clear.
A miniature in an illuminated <i>Histoire de la belle Hélaine</i> in the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (end of the 14th or beginning of
the 15th century) shows an infant sleeping in a tiny four-post
bed slung upon rockers. In its oldest forms the cradle is an
oblong oak box without a lid&mdash;originally the rockers appear to
have been detachable&mdash;but, like all other household appliances,
it has been subject to changes of fashion alike in shape and
adornment. It has been panelled and carved, supported on
Renaissance pillars, inlaid with marqueterie or mounted in
gilded bronze. The original simple shape persisted for two or
three centuries&mdash;even the hood made its appearance very early.
In the 18th century, however, cradles were often very elaborate&mdash;indeed
in France they had begun to be so much earlier, but the
richly carved and upholstered examples were used chiefly for
purposes of state, being in fact miniature <i>lits de parade</i>. In
modern times they have become lighter and simpler, the old hood
being very often replaced by a draped curtain dependent from a
carved or shaped upright. About the middle of the 19th century
iron cradles were introduced, along with iron bedsteads. A
number of undoubted historic cradles have been preserved,
together with many others with doubtful attributions. Two
alleged cradles of Henry V. exist; one which claims to have been
used by the unhappy earl of Derwentwater is in the Victoria
and Albert Museum in London; the other is at Windsor Castle.
That of Henry IV. of France, now in the Château de Pau, is
mounted upon a large tortoiseshell. That of the king of Rome
(&ldquo;Napoleon II.&rdquo;) was designed by Prud&rsquo;hon, and along with that
of the comte de Chambord is preserved in the Garde Meuble.
In England a cradle is now often called a &ldquo;bassinet&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
little basket), and the &ldquo;cot&rdquo; has to some extent taken its place.
By analogy, the word &ldquo;cradle&rdquo; is also applied to various
sorts of framework in engineering, and to a rocking-tool
used in engraving.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRADOCK<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span>, a town of South Africa, capital of a division of the
Cape province, in the upper valley of the Great Fish river, 181 m.
by rail N. by E. of Port Elizabeth. Pop. (1904) 7762. It is one
of the chief centres of the wool industry of the Cape, and does also
a large trade in ostrich feathers, mohair, &amp;c. The town enjoys
a reputation as one of the best health resorts in the province.
It stands at an altitude of 2856 ft.; the climate is very dry,
the average annual rainfall being 14.50 in. The mean maximum
temperature is 77.6° F. Three miles N. of the town are sulphur
baths (temp. 100° F.) used for the treatment of rheumatism. In
the neighbouring district survive a few herds of zebras, now
protected by the game laws. The town dates from the beginning
of the 19th century and is named after Sir John Cradock,
governor of the Cape 1811-1813. The division has an area of
3048 sq. m. and a pop. (1904) of 18,803, of whom 41% are white.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAFT<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (a word common to Teutonic languages for strength,
or power; cf. Ger. <i>Kraft</i>), a word confined in English only, of
the Teutonic languages in which it occurs, to intellectual power,
and used as a synonym of &ldquo;art.&rdquo; It then means skill or ingenuity,
especially in the manual arts, hence its use in the
expression &ldquo;Arts and Crafts&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), and it is thus applied to
the trade or profession in which such skill is displayed, to an
association of workmen of a particular trade, a trade gild, and
in particular to Freemasons, &ldquo;the craft&rdquo;; the word appears
also in words such as &ldquo;handicraft&rdquo; or &ldquo;craftsman.&rdquo; Skill
applied to outwit or deceive gives the common sense of cunning
or trickery, and it is this meaning which is implied in such
combined words as &ldquo;priestcraft,&rdquo; &ldquo;witchcraft&rdquo; and the like.
A more particular use of the word is in the nautical sense of
vessels of transport by water; this is probably a colloquially
shortened form either of &ldquo;vessels of a fisherman&rsquo;s, lighterman&rsquo;s
&amp;c., craft,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;art,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;vessels of a heavier or lighter
craft,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> burden or capacity; in both cases the qualifying
words are dropped and the word comes to be used of vessels in
general.</p>

modern Scots <i>craig</i>), a steep rock. The word appears in many
place-names in the north of England and in Scotland, and is also
connected with &ldquo;carrick,&rdquo; a word of similar meaning, also
found in place-names. In geology, the term is applied to the
strata in which a shelly sand deposit is found, and, in the expression
&ldquo;crag and tail,&rdquo; to a formation of hills, in which one side is
precipitous and lofty and the other slopes or &ldquo;tails&rdquo; gradually
away, as in the Castle Rock in Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAGGS, JAMES<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1657-1721), English politician, was a son of
Anthony Craggs of Holbeck, Durham, and was baptized on the
10th of June 1657. After following various callings in London,
Craggs, who was a person of considerable financial ability,
entered the service of the duchess of Marlborough, and through
her influence became in 1702 member of parliament for Grampound,
retaining his seat until 1713. He was in business as an
army clothier and held several official positions, becoming joint
postmaster-general in 1715; and, making the most of his
opportunities in all these capacities, he amassed a great deal of
money. Craggs also increased his wealth by mixing in the
affairs of the South Sea Company, but after his death an act of
parliament confiscated all the property which he had acquired
since December 1719. He left an enormous fortune when he
died on the 16th of March 1721. It is possible that Craggs
committed suicide.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">James Craggs</span> the younger (1686-1721), was born at
Westminster on the 9th of April 1686. Part of his early life was
spent abroad, where he made the acquaintance of George
Louis, elector of Hanover, afterwards King George I. In 1713
he became member of parliament for Tregoney, in 1717 secretary-at-war,
and in the following year one of the principal secretaries
of state. Craggs was implicated in the South Sea Bubble, but
not so deeply as his father, whom he predeceased, dying on the
16th of February 1721. Among Craggs&rsquo;s friends were Pope, who
wrote the epitaph on his monument in Westminster Abbey,
Addison and Gay.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAIG, JOHN<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1512?-1600), Scottish reformer, born about
1512, was the son of Craig of Craigston, Aberdeenshire, who was
killed at Flodden in 1513. After an education at St Andrews,
and acting as tutor to the children of Lord Darcy, the English
warden of the North, he became a Dominican, but was soon in
trouble as a heretic. In 1536 he made his way to England, but
failing to obtain the preferment he desired at Cambridge, he
went on to Italy, where the influence of Cardinal Pole, who was
himself accused of heresy, secured him the post of master of the
novices in the Dominican convent at Bologna. For some years he
was busy travelling in the Levant in the interests of his order, but
a perusal of Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Institutes</i> revived his heretical tendencies,
and he was condemned to be burnt. Like the English scholar and
statesman, Thomas Wilson, he owed his escape to the riot which
broke out on the death of Paul IV. on the 18th of August 1559,
when the mob burst open the prison of the Inquisition. After
various adventures he reached Vienna, where he preached, and
was protected by the semi-Lutheran archduke (afterwards the
emperor) Maximilian II.</p>

<p>In 1560 he returned to Scotland, where in 1561 he was ordained
minister of Holyrood, and in 1562 Knox&rsquo;s colleague in the High
Church. His defence of church property and privilege against the
predatory instincts of the nobles and the pretensions of the state
brought him into conflict with Lethington and others; but he
seems to have condoned, if he was not privy to, Riccio&rsquo;s murder.
At first he refused to publish the banns of marriage between
Mary and Bothwell, though in the end he yielded with a protest
that he &ldquo;abhorred and detested the marriage.&rdquo; He had been
associated with Knox in various commissions for the organization
of the church, but he wished to compromise between the two
extreme parties. From 1571-1579 Craig was in the north,
whither he had been sent to &ldquo;illuminate those dark places in Mar,
Buchan and Aberdeen.&rdquo; In 1579 he was appointed chaplain to
the young James VI., and returned to Edinburgh. In 1581
episcopacy was abolished as a result of the report of a commission
on which Craig had sat; he also assisted at the composition of
the <i>Second Book of Discipline</i> and the National Covenant of 1580,
and in 1581 compiled &ldquo;Ane Shorte and Generale Confession&rdquo;
called the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Confession,&rdquo; which was imposed on all parish
ministers and graduates and became the basis of the Covenant of
1638. He approved of the Ruthven raid, and admonished James
in terms which made him weep, but produced no alteration in his
conduct, and before long Craig was denouncing the supremacy of
Arran. But he was averse from the violence of Melville, and was
willing to admit the royal supremacy &ldquo;as far as the word of God
allows.&rdquo; James VI., <span class="correction" title="amended from Like">like</span> Henry VIII., accepted this compromise,
and the oath in this form was taken by Craig, the royal chaplains
and some others. In 1592 was published Craig&rsquo;s <i>Catechism</i>.
He died on the 12th of December 1600.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAIG, SIR THOMAS<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (c. 1538-1608), Scottish jurist and poet,
was born about 1538. It is probable that he was the eldest son of
William Craig of Craigfintray, or Craigston, in Aberdeenshire, but
beyond the fact that he was in some way related to the Craigfintray
family nothing regarding his birth is known with certainty.
He was educated at St Andrews, where he took the B.A. degree in
1555. From St Andrews he went to France, to study the canon
and the civil law. He returned to Scotland about 1561, and was
admitted advocate in February 1563. In 1564 he was appointed
justice-depute by the justice-general, Archibald, earl of Argyll;
and in this capacity he presided at many of the criminal trials
of the period. In 1573 he was appointed sheriff-depute of
Edinburgh, and in 1606 procurator for the church. He never
became a lord of session, a circumstance that was unquestionably
due to his own choice. It is said that he refused the honour of
knighthood which the king wished to confer on him in 1604,
when he came to London as one of the Scottish commissioners
regarding the union between the kingdoms&mdash;the only political
object he seems to have cared about; but in accordance with
James&rsquo;s commands he has always been styled and reputed a
knight. Craig was married to Helen, daughter of Heriot of
Lumphoy in Midlothian, by whom he had four sons and three
daughters. His eldest son, Sir Lewis Craig (1569-1622), was
raised to the bench in 1604, and among his other descendants are
several well-known names in the list of Scottish lawyers. He died
on the 26th of February 1608.</p>

<p>Except his poems, the only one of Craig&rsquo;s works which appeared
during his lifetime was his <i>Jus feudale</i> (1603; ed. R. Burnet,
1655; Leipzig, 1716; ed. J. Baillie 1732). The object of this
treatise was to assimilate the laws of England and Scotland, but,
instead of this, it was an important factor in building up and
solidifying the law of Scotland into a separate system. Other
works were <i>De unione regnorum Britanniae tractatus, De jure
successionis regni Angliae</i> and <i>De hominio disputatio</i>. Translations
of the last two have been published, and in 1910 an edition of the
<i>De Unione</i> appeared, with translation and notes by C. S. Terry.
Craig&rsquo;s first poem, an <i>Epithalamium</i> in honour of the marriage of
Mary queen of Scots and Darnley, appeared in 1565. Most of his
poems have been reprinted in the <i>Delitiae poëtarum Scotorum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAIGIE, PEARL MARY TERESA<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1867-1906), Anglo-American
novelist and dramatist, who wrote under the pen-name
of &ldquo;<span class="sc">John Oliver Hobbes</span>,&rdquo; was born at Boston, U.S.A., on the
3rd of November 1867. She was the elder daughter of John
Morgan Richards, and was educated in London and Paris.
When she was nineteen she married Reginald Walpole Craigie,
by whom she had one son, John Churchill Craigie: but the
marriage proved an unhappy one, and was dissolved on her
petition in July 1895. She was brought up as a Nonconformist,
but in 1892 was received into the Roman Catholic
Church, of which she remained a devout and serious member.
Her first little book, the brilliant and epigrammatic <i>Some
Emotions and a Moral</i>, was published in 1891 in Mr Fisher Unwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pseudonym Library,&rdquo; and was followed by <i>The Sinner&rsquo;s
Comedy</i> (1892), <i>A Study in Temptations</i> (1893), <i>A Bundle of Life</i>
(1894), <i>The Gods, Some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham</i>. <i>The Herb
Moon</i> (1896), a country love story, was followed by <i>The School for
Saints</i> (1897), with a sequel, <i>Robert Orange</i> (1900). Mrs Craigie
had already written a one-act &ldquo;proverb,&rdquo; <i>Journeys end in Lovers
Meeting</i>, produced by Ellen Terry in 1894, and a three-act
tragedy, &ldquo;Osbern and Ursyne,&rdquo; printed in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Review</i> (1899), when her successful piece, <i>The Ambassador</i>, was
produced at the St James&rsquo;s Theatre in 1898. <i>A Repentance</i> (one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
act, 1899) and <i>The Wisdom of the Wise</i> (1900) were produced at
the same theatre, and <i>The Flute of Pan</i> (1904) first at
Manchester and then at the Shaftesbury theatre; she was also
part author of <i>The Bishop&rsquo;s Move</i> (Garrick Theatre, 1902).
Later books are <i>The Serious Wooing</i> (1901), <i>Love and the Soul
Hunters</i> (1902), <i>Tales about Temperament</i> (1902), <i>The Vineyard</i>
(1904). Mrs Craigie died suddenly of heart failure in London on
the 13th of August 1906.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAIK, DINAH MARIA<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (1826-1887), English novelist,
better known by her maiden name of Mulock, and still better
as &ldquo;the author of <i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i>,&rdquo; was the daughter
of Thomas Mulock, an eccentric religious enthusiast of Irish
extraction, and was born on the 20th of April 1826 at Stoke-upon-Trent,
in Staffordshire, where her father was the minister of a
small congregation. She settled in London about 1846, determined
to obtain a livelihood by her pen, and, beginning with
fiction for children, advanced steadily until <i>John Halifax,
Gentleman</i> (1857), placed her in the front rank of the women
novelists of her day. <i>A Life for a Life</i> (1859), though inferior,
maintained a high position, but she afterwards wrote little of
importance except some very charming tales for children. Her
most remarkable novels, after those mentioned above, were <i>The
Ogilvies</i> (1849), <i>Olive</i> (1850), <i>The Head of the Family</i> (1851),
<i>Agatha&rsquo;s Husband</i> (1853). There is much passion and power in
these early works, and all that Mrs Craik wrote was characterized
by high principle and deep feeling. Some of the short stories in
<i>Avillion and other Tales</i> also exhibit a fine imagination. She
published some poems distinguished by genuine lyrical spirit,
narratives of tours in Ireland and Cornwall, and <i>A Woman&rsquo;s
Thoughts about Women</i>. She married Mr G. L. Craik, a partner in
the house of Macmillan &amp; Company, in 1864, and died at Shortlands,
near Bromley, Kent, on the 12th of October 1887.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAIK, GEORGE LILLIE<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (1798-1866), English man of letters,
the son of a schoolmaster, was born at Kennoway, Fifeshire, in
1798. He studied at the university of St Andrews with the
intention of entering the church, but, altering his plans, became
the editor of a local newspaper, and went to London in 1824 to
devote himself to literature. He became connected with a short-lived
literary paper called the <i>Verulam</i>; in 1831 he published his
<i>Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties</i> among the works of the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; he contributed a
considerable number of biographical and historical articles to
the <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i>; and he edited the <i>Pictorial History of
England</i>, himself writing much of the work. In 1844 he published
his <i>History of Literature and Learning in England from the Norman
Conquest to the Present Time</i>, illustrated by extracts. Craik is
best known for his abridged version of this work, <i>The History of
English Literature and the English Language</i> (1861), which passed
through several editions. In the next year appeared his <i>Spenser
and his Poetry</i>, an abstract of Spenser&rsquo;s poems, with historical
and biographical notes and frequent quotations; and in 1847 his
<i>Bacon, his Writings and his Philosophy</i>, a work of a similar kind.
The two last-mentioned works appeared among <i>Knight&rsquo;s Weekly
Volumes</i>. Two years later Craik obtained the chair of history and
English literature at Queen&rsquo;s College, Belfast, a position which he
held till his death, which took place on the 25th of June 1866.
He had married Miss Jeannette Dempster (d. 1856) in 1826, and
his daughter, Georgiana Marion Craik (Mrs A. W. May), wrote
over thirty novels, of which <i>Lost and Won</i> (1859) was the best.
Besides the works already noticed, Craik published the <i>History of
British Commerce from the Earliest Times</i> (1844), <i>Romance of the
Peerage</i> (1848-1850) and <i>The English of Shakespeare</i> (1856).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAIL<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (formerly <span class="sc">Karel</span>), a royal and police burgh of Fifeshire,
Scotland, 2 m. from Fife Ness, the most easterly point of the
county, and 11 m. S.E. of St Andrews by the North British
railway, but 2 m. nearer by road. Pop. (1901) 1077. It is said
to have been a town of some note as early as the 9th century;
and its castle, of which there are hardly any remains, was the
residence of David I. and other Scottish kings. It was constituted
a royal burgh by a charter of Robert Bruce in 1306, and
had its privileges confirmed by Robert II. in 1371, by Mary in
1553, and by Charles I. in 1635. Of its priory, dedicated to
St Rufus, a few ruins still exist. The church of Maelrubha, the
patron saint of Crail, is an edifice of great antiquity. Many of the
ordinary houses are massive and quaint. The public buildings
include a library and reading-room and town hall. The chief
industries comprise fisheries, especially for crabs, shipping and
brewing. It is growing in favour as a summer resort. It unites
with St Andrews, the two Anstruthers, Kilrenny, Pittenweem
and Cupar in returning one member to parliament.</p>

<p>Balcomie Castle, about 2 m. to the N.E., dates from the 14th
century. Here Mary of Guise landed in 1538, a few days before
her marriage to James V. in St Andrews cathedral. In the 18th
century it passed through the hands of various proprietors and
was ultimately shorn of much of its original size and grandeur.
The East Neuk is a term applied more particularly to the
country round Fife Ness, and more generally to all of the peninsula
east of an imaginary line drawn from St Andrews to Elie. For
fully half the year the cottages of its villages are damp with the
haar, or dense mist, borne on the east wind from the North Sea.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAILSHEIM<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Krailsheim</span>, a town of Germany, in the
kingdom of Württemberg, on the Jagst, a tributary of the
Neckar, at the junction of railways to Heilbronn and Fürth.
Pop. (1900) 5251. There are two Evangelical churches and a
Roman Catholic church, and a handsome town hall, with a tower
225 ft. high. The industrial establishments include extensive
tanneries and machine workshops, and there is a brisk trade in
cattle and agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Crailsheim was incorporated as a town in 1338, successfully
withstood a siege by the forces of several Swabian imperial cities
(1379-1380), a feat which is annually celebrated, passed later
into the possession of the burgraves of Nuremberg, and came
in 1791 to Prussia, in 1806 to Bavaria and 1810 to Württemberg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAIOVA,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Krajova</span>, the capital of the department of
Doljiu, Rumania, situated near the left bank of the river Jiu, and
on the main Walachian railway from Verciorova to Bucharest.
Pop. (1900) 45,438. A branch railway to Calafat facilitates the
export trade with Bulgaria. Craiova is the chief commercial
town west of Bucharest; the surrounding uplands are very rich
in grain, pasturage and vegetable products, and contain extensive
forests. The town has rope and carriage factories, and close by
is a large tannery, worked by convict labour, and supplying the
army. The principal trade is in cattle, cereals, fish, linen,
pottery, glue and leather. In the town, which is the headquarters
of the First Army Corps, there are military and commercial
academies, an appeal court and a chamber of commerce,
besides many churches, Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and
Protestant, with synagogues for the Jews.</p>

<p>Craiova, which occupied the site of the Roman Castra Nova,
was formerly the capital of Little Walachia. Its ancient <i>bans</i> or
military governors were, next to the princes, the chief dignitaries
of Walachia, and the district is still styled the banat of Craiova.
Among the holders of this office were Michael the Brave (1593-1601),
and several members of the celebrated Bassarab family
(<i>q.v.</i>). The bans had the right of coining money stamped with
their own effigies, and hence arose the name of <i>bani</i> (centimes).
The Rumanian franc, or <i>leu</i> (&ldquo;lion&rdquo;), so called from the image it
bore, came likewise from Craiova. In 1397 Craiova was the
scene of a victory won by Prince Mircea over Bayezid I. sultan
of the Turks; and in October 1853, of an engagement between
Turks and Russians.</p>

(<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>), was played as early as the 14th century
under the name of the <i>ABC of Aristotle</i>. In the days of the
Stuarts it was very popular, and is frequently mentioned in the
writings of the time. Thus Congreve&rsquo;s <i>Love for Love</i>, i. 1, contains
the passage, &ldquo;Get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and
learn the knack of Rhiming.&rdquo; Crambo, or capping the rhyme,
is now played by one player thinking of a word and telling the
others what it rhymes with, the others not naming the actual
word they guess but its meaning. Thus one says &ldquo;I know a word
that rhymes with <i>bird</i>.&rdquo; A second asks &ldquo;Is it ridiculous?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, it is not absurd.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it a part of speech?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it is not
a word.&rdquo; This proceeds until the right word is guessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span></p>

<p>In <i>Dumb Crambo</i> the guessers, instead of naming the word,
express its meaning by dumb show, a rhyme being given them as

February 1771. He was the son of Wilhelm Cramer (1743-1799).
a famous London violinist and musical conductor, one of a
numerous family who were identified with the progress of music
during the 18th and 19th centuries. Johann Baptist was brought
to London as a child, and it was in London that the greater part
of his musical efforts was exercised. From 1782 to 1784 he
studied the pianoforte under Muzio Clementi, and soon became
known as a professional pianist both in London and on the
continent; he enjoyed a world-wide reputation, and was
particularly appreciated by Beethoven. He died in London
on the 16th of April 1858. Apart from his pianoforte-playing
Cramer is important as a composer, and as principal founder
in 1824 of the London music-publishing house of Cramer &amp; Co.
He wrote a number of sonatas, &amp;c., for pianoforte, and other
compositions; but his <i>Études</i> is the work by which he lives as
a composer. These &ldquo;studies&rdquo; have appeared in numerous
editions, from 1810 onwards, and became the staple pieces in the
training of pianists.</p>

He was educated at Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford.
He resided in Oxford till 1844, during which time he held many
important offices, being public orator, principal of New Inn Hall
(which he rebuilt at his own expense), and professor of modern
history. In 1844 he was appointed to the deanery of Carlisle,
which he held until his death at Scarborough on the 24th of
August 1848. His works are of considerable importance: <i>A

anonymously with H. L. Wickham (2nd ed., 1828), &ldquo;a scholar-like
work of first-rate ability&rdquo;; geographical and historical
descriptions of <i>Ancient Italy</i> (1826), <i>Ancient Greece</i> (1828), <i>Asia

<p><span class="bold">CRÄMER, KARL VON<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (1818-1902), Bavarian politician, had
a very remarkable career, rising gradually from a mere workman
in a factory at Doos near Nuremberg to the post of manager,
and finally becoming part proprietor of the establishment. Leaving
business in 1870 he devoted his time entirely to politics.
From 1848 he had been a member of the Bavarian second chamber,
at first representing the district of Erlangen-Fürth, and afterwards
Nuremberg, which city also sent him after the war of
1866 as its deputy to the German customs parliament, and from
1871 to 1874 to the first German <i>Reichstag</i>. He sat in these
bodies as a member of the Progressive party (<i>Fortschrittspartei</i>),
and in Bavaria was one of the leaders of the Liberal (<i>Freisinnige</i>)
party. His eloquence had a great hold upon the masses. As a
parliamentarian he was very clear-headed, and thoroughly
understood how to lead a party. For many years he was the
reporter of the finance committee of the chamber. In 1882, on
account of his great services in connexion with the Bavarian
National Exhibition of Nuremberg, the order of the crown of
Bavaria was conferred upon him, carrying with it the honour of
nobility. He died at Nuremberg on the 31st of December 1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAMP, CHARLES HENRY<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (1828-&emsp;&emsp;), American shipbuilder,
was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 9th
of May 1828, of German descent, his family name having been
Krampf. He was the eldest of eleven children of William
Cramp (1807-1869), a pioneer American shipbuilder, who in 1830
established shipyards on the Delaware river near Philadelphia.
The son was educated at the Philadelphia Central high school,
after which he was employed in his father&rsquo;s shipyards and made
himself master of every detail of ship construction. He showed
especial aptitude as a naval architect and designer, and after
becoming his father&rsquo;s partner in 1849 it was to that branch of
the work that he devoted himself. His inventive capacity and
resourcefulness, together with the complete success of his
innovations in naval construction, soon gave him high rank
as an authority on shipbuilding, and made his influence in that
industry widely felt. In the Mexican War he designed surf
boats for the landing of troops at Vera Cruz; during the Civil
War he designed and built several ironclads for the United
States navy, notably the &ldquo;New Ironsides&rdquo; in 1862, and the
light-draught monitors used in the Carolina sounds; and after
1887 constructed wholly or in part from his own designs many
of the most powerful ships in the &ldquo;new&rdquo; navy, including
the cruisers &ldquo;Columbia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Minneapolis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brooklyn,&rdquo;
and the battleships &ldquo;Indiana,&rdquo; &ldquo;Iowa,&rdquo; &ldquo;Massachusetts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Alabama&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maine.&rdquo; In every progressive step in ocean
shipbuilding, in the transformation from sail to steam, and
from wood to iron and steel, Cramp had a prominent part. His
fame as a shipbuilder extended to Europe, and he built warships
for several foreign navies, among others the &ldquo;Retvizan&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Variag&rdquo; for the Russian government. He also constructed
a number of freight and passenger steamships for several
trans-Atlantic lines.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAMP,<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> a painful spasmodic contraction of muscles, most
frequently occurring in the limbs, but also apt to affect certain
internal organs. This disorder belongs to the class of diseases
known as local spasms, of which other varieties exist in such
affections as spasmodic asthma and colic. The cause of these
painful seizures resides in the nervous system, and operates
either directly from the great nerve centres, or, as is generally
the case, indirectly by reflex action, as, for example, when attacks
are brought on by some derangement of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>In its most common form, that of cramp in the limbs, this
disorder comes on suddenly, often during sleep, the patient
being aroused by an agonizing feeling of pain in the calf of the
leg or back of the thigh, accompanied in many instances with a
sensation of sickness or faintness from the intensity of the suffering.
During the paroxysm the muscular fibres affected can often
be felt gathered up into a hard knot. The attack in general
lasts but a few seconds, and then suddenly departs, the spasmodic
contraction of the muscles ceasing entirely, or, on the other
hand, relief may come more gradually during a period of minutes
or even hours. A liability to cramp is often associated with a
rheumatic or gouty tendency, but occasional attacks are common
enough apart from this, and are often induced by some peculiar
posture which a limb has assumed during sleep. Exposure of the
limbs to cold will also bring on cramp, and to this is probably to
be ascribed its frequent occurrence in swimmers. Cramp of the
extremities is also well known as one of the most distressing
accompaniments of cholera. It is likewise of frequent occurrence
in the process of parturition, just before delivery.</p>

<p>This painful disorder can be greatly relieved and often entirely
removed by firmly grasping or briskly rubbing the affected part
with the hand, or by anything which makes an impression on the
nerves, such as warm applications. Even a sudden and vigorous
movement of the limb will often succeed in terminating the attack.</p>

<p>What is termed cramp of the stomach, or gastralgia, usually
occurs as a symptom in connexion with some form of gastric
disorder, such as aggravated dyspepsia, or actual organic disease
of the mucous membrane of the stomach.</p>

<p>The disease known as <i>Writer&rsquo;s Cramp</i>, or <i>Scrivener&rsquo;s Palsy</i>, is
a spasm which affects certain muscles when engaged in the performance
of acts, the result of education and long usage, and
which does not occur when the same muscles are employed in
acts of a different kind. This disorder owes its name to the
relative frequency with which it is met in persons who write
much, although it is by no means confined to them, but is liable
to occur in individuals of almost any handicraft. It was termed
by Dr Duchenne <i>Functional Spasm</i>.</p>

<p>The symptoms are in the first instance a gradually increasing
difficulty experienced in conducting the movements required
for executing the work in hand. Taking, for example, the case
of writers, there is a feeling that the pen cannot be moved with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
the same freedom as before, and the handwriting is more or less
altered in consequence. At an early stage of the disease the
difficulty may be to a large extent overcome by persevering
efforts, but ultimately, when the attempt is persisted in, the
muscles of the fingers, and occasionally also those of the forearm,
are seized with spasm or cramp, so that the act of writing is
rendered impossible. Sometimes the fingers, instead of being
cramped, move in a disorderly manner and the pen cannot be
grasped, while in other rare instances a kind of paralysis affects
the muscles of the fingers, and they are powerless to make the
movements necessary for holding the pen. It is to be noted that
it is only in the act of writing that these phenomena present
themselves, and that for all other movements the fingers and
arms possess their natural power. The same symptoms are
observed and the same remarks apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> in the
case of musicians, artists, compositors, seamstresses, tailors and
many mechanics in whom this affection may occur. Indeed,
although actually a rare disease, no muscle or group of muscles
in the body which is specially called into action in any particular
occupation is exempt from liability to this functional spasm.</p>

<p>The exact pathology of writer&rsquo;s cramp has not been worked
out, but it is now generally accepted that the disease is not a local
one of muscles or nerves, but that it is an affection of the central
nervous system. The complaint never occurs under thirty years
of age, and is more frequent in males than females. Occasionally
there is an inherited tendency to the disease, but more usually
there is a history of alcoholism in the parents, or some neuropathic
heredity. In its treatment the first requisite is absolute
cessation from the employment which caused it. Usually,
however, complete rest of the arm is undesirable, and recovery
takes place more speedily if other actions of a different kind are
regularly practised. If a return to the same work is a necessity,
then Sir W. R. Gowers insists on some modification of method in
performing the act, as writing from the shoulder instead of the
wrist.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAMP-RINGS,<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> rings anciently worn as a cure for cramp and
&ldquo;falling-sickness&rdquo; or epilepsy. The legend is that the first one
was presented to Edward the Confessor by a pilgrim on his
return from Jerusalem, its miraculous properties being explained
to the king. At his death it passed into the keeping of the abbot
of Westminster, by whom it was used medically and was known
as St Edward&rsquo;s Ring. From that time the belief grew that the
successors of Edward inherited his powers, and that the rings
blessed by them worked cures. Hence arose the custom for the
successive sovereigns of England each year on Good Friday
formally to bless a number of cramp-rings. A service was held;
prayers and psalms were said; and water &ldquo;in the name of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost&rdquo; was poured over the rings, which
were always of gold or silver, and made from the metal that the
king offered to the Cross on Good Friday. The ceremony
survived to the reign of Queen Mary, but the belief in the curative
powers of similar circlets of sacred metal has lingered on even to
the present day.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRANACH, LUCAS<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1472-1553), German painter, was born at
Cronach in upper Franconia, and learnt the art of drawing from
his father. It has not been possible to trace his descent or the
name of his parents. We are not informed as to the school in
which he was taught, and it is a mere guess that he took lessons
from the south German masters to whom Mathew Grunewald
owed his education. But Grunewald practised at Bamberg and
Aschaffenburg, and Bamberg is the capital of the diocese in
which Cronach lies. According to Gunderam, the tutor of
Cranach&rsquo;s children, Cranach signalized his talents as a painter
before the close of the 15th century. He then drew upon himself
the attention of the elector of Saxony, who attached him to his
person in 1504. The records of Wittenberg confirm Gunderam&rsquo;s
statement to this extent that Cranach&rsquo;s name appears for the
first time in the public accounts on the 24th of June 1504, when
he drew 50 gulden for the salary of half a year, as <i>pictor ducalis</i>.
The only clue to Cranach&rsquo;s settlement previous to his Wittenberg
appointment is afforded by the knowledge that he owned a
house at Gotha, and that Barbara Brengbier, his wife, was the
daughter of a burgher of that city.</p>

<p>Of his skill as an artist we have sufficient evidence in a picture
dated 1504. But as to the development of his manner prior to
that date we are altogether in ignorance. In contrast with this
obscurity is the light thrown upon Cranach after 1504. We find
him active in several branches of his profession,&mdash;sometimes a
mere house-painter, more frequently producing portraits and
altar-pieces, a designer on wood, an engraver of copper-plates,
and draughtsman for the dies of the electoral mint. Early in the
days of his official employment he startled his master&rsquo;s courtiers
by the realism with which he painted still life, game and antlers
on the walls of the country palaces at Coburg and Lochau; his
pictures of deer and wild boar were considered striking, and the
duke fostered his passion for this form of art by taking him out to
the hunting field, where he sketched &ldquo;his grace&rdquo; running the
stag, or Duke John sticking a boar. Before 1508 he had painted
several altar-pieces for the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg in
competition with Dürer, Burgkmair and others; the duke and his
brother John were portrayed in various attitudes and a number
of the best woodcuts and copper-plates were published. Great
honour accrued to Cranach when he went in 1509 to the Netherlands,
and took sittings from the emperor Maximilian and the boy
who afterwards became Charles V. Till 1508 Cranach signed his
works with the initials of his name. In that year the elector gave
him the winged snake as a motto, and this motto or <i>Kleinod</i>, as it
was called, superseded the initials on all his pictures after that
date. Somewhat later the duke conferred on him the monopoly
of the sale of medicines at Wittenberg, and a printer&rsquo;s patent with
exclusive privileges as to copyright in Bibles. The presses of
Cranach were used by Luther. His chemist&rsquo;s shop was open for
centuries, and only perished by fire in 1871. Relations of friendship
united the painter with the Reformers at a very early period;
yet it is difficult to fix the time of his first acquaintance with
Luther. The oldest notice of Cranach in the Reformer&rsquo;s correspondence
dates from 1520. In a letter written from Worms in
1521, Luther calls him his gossip, warmly alluding to his
&ldquo;Gevatterin,&rdquo; the artist&rsquo;s wife. His first engraved portrait by
Cranach represents an Augustinian friar, and is dated 1520.
Five years later the friar dropped the cowl, and Cranach was
present as &ldquo;one of the council&rdquo; at the betrothal festival of
Luther and Catherine Bora. The death at short intervals of the
electors Frederick and John (1525 and 1532) brought no change
in the prosperous situation of the painter; he remained a
favourite with John Frederick I., under whose administration he
twice (1537 and 1540) filled the office of burgomaster of Wittenberg.
But 1547 witnessed a remarkable change in these relations.
John Frederick was taken prisoner at the battle of Mühlberg,
and Wittenberg was subjected to stress of siege. As Cranach
wrote from his house at the corner of the market-place to the
grand-master Albert of Brandenburg at Königsberg to tell him
of John Frederick&rsquo;s capture, he showed his attachment by
saying, &ldquo;I cannot conceal from your Grace that we have been
robbed of our dear prince, who from his youth upwards has been a
true prince to us, but God will help him out of prison, for the
Kaiser is bold enough to revive the Papacy, which God will
certainly not allow.&rdquo; During the siege Charles bethought him of
Cranach, whom he remembered from his childhood and summoned
him to his camp at Pistritz. Cranach came, reminded his majesty
of his early sittings as a boy, and begged on his knees for kind
treatment to the elector. Three years afterwards, when all the
dignitaries of the Empire met at Augsburg to receive commands
from the emperor, and when Titian at Charles&rsquo;s bidding came to
take the likeness of Philip of Spain, John Frederick asked
Cranach to visit the Swabian capital; and here for a few months
he was numbered amongst the household of the captive elector,
whom he afterwards accompanied home in 1552. He died
on the 16th of October 1553 at Weimar, where the house in
which he lived still stands in the market-place.</p>

<p>The oldest extant picture of Cranach, the &ldquo;Rest of the Virgin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
during the Flight into Egypt,&rdquo; marked with the initials L.C., and
the date of 1504, is by far the most graceful creation of his pencil.
The scene is laid on the margin of a forest of pines, and discloses
the habits of a painter familiar with the mountain scenery of
Thuringia. There is more of gloom in landscapes of a later time;
and this would point to a defect in the taste of Cranach, whose
stag hunts are otherwise not unpleasing. Cranach&rsquo;s art in its
prime was doubtless influenced by causes which but slightly
affected the art of the Italians, but weighed with potent consequence
on that of the Netherlands and Germany. The business
of booksellers who sold woodcuts and engravings at fairs and
markets in Germany naturally satisfied a craving which arose
out of the paucity of wall-paintings in churches and secular
edifices. Drawing for woodcuts and engraving of copper-plates
became the occupation of artists of note, and the talents devoted
in Italy to productions of the brush were here monopolized for
designs on wood or on copper. We have thus to account for
the comparative unproductiveness as painters of Dürer and
Holbein, and at the same time to explain the shallowness apparent
in many of the later works of Cranach; but we attribute to the
same cause also the tendency in Cranach to neglect effective
colour and light and shade for strong contrasts of flat tint.
Constant attention to mere contour and to black and white
appears to have affected his sight, and caused those curious
transitions of pallid light into inky grey which often characterize
his studies of flesh; whilst the mere outlining of form in black
became a natural substitute for modelling and chiaroscuro.
There are, no doubt, some few pictures by Cranach in which
the flesh-tints display brightness and enamelled surface, but
they are quite exceptional. As a composer Cranach was not
greatly gifted. His ideal of the human shape was low; but he
showed some freshness in the delineation of incident, though he
not unfrequently bordered on coarseness. His copper-plates
and woodcuts are certainly the best outcome of his art; and
the earlier they are in date the more conspicuous is their power.
Striking evidence of this is the &ldquo;St Christopher&rdquo; of 1506, or the
plate of &ldquo;Elector Frederick praying before the Madonna&rdquo; (1509).
It is curious to watch the changes which mark the development
of his instincts as an artist during the struggles of the Reformation.
At first we find him painting Madonnas. His first woodcut
(1505) represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before
a crucifix. Later on he composes the marriage of St Catherine,
a series of martyrdoms, and scenes from the Passion. After 1517
he illustrates occasionally the old gospel themes, but he also
gives expression to some of the thoughts of the Reformers.
In a picture of 1518 at Leipzig, where a dying man offers &ldquo;his
soul to God, his body to earth, and his worldly goods to his
relations,&rdquo; the soul rises to meet the Trinity in heaven, and
salvation is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good
works. Again sin and grace become a familiar subject of pictorial
delineation. Adam is observed sitting between John the Baptist
and a prophet at the foot of a tree. To the left God produces
the tables of the law, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden
fruit, the brazen serpent is reared aloft, and punishment supervenes
in the shape of death and the realm of Satan. To the
right, the Conception, Crucifixion and Resurrection symbolize
redemption, and this is duly impressed on Adam by John the
Baptist, who points to the sacrifice of the crucified Saviour.
There are two examples of this composition in the galleries of
Gotha and Prague, both of them dated 1529. One of the latest
pictures with which the name of Cranach is connected is the altarpiece
which Cranach&rsquo;s son completed in 1555, and which is now
in the <i>Stadtkirche</i> (city church) at Weimar. It represents Christ
in two forms, to the left trampling on Death and Satan, to the
right crucified, with blood flowing from the lance wound. John
the Baptist points to the suffering Christ, whilst the blood-stream
falls on the head of Cranach, and Luther reads from his book
the words, &ldquo;The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.&rdquo; Cranach
sometimes composed gospel subjects with feeling and dignity.
&ldquo;The Woman taken in Adultery&rdquo; at Munich is a favourable specimen
of his skill, and various repetitions of Christ receiving little
children show the kindliness of his disposition. But he was not
exclusively a religious painter. He was equally successful, and
often comically naïve, in mythological scenes, as where Cupid,
who has stolen a honeycomb, complains to Venus that he has been
stung by a bee (Weimar, 1530; Berlin, 1534), or where Hercules
sits at the spinning-wheel mocked by Omphale and her maids.
Humour and pathos are combined at times with strong effect in
pictures such as the &ldquo;Jealousy&rdquo; (Augsburg, 1527; Vienna, 1530),
where women and children are huddled into telling groups as
they watch the strife of men wildly fighting around them. Very
realistic must have been a lost canvas of 1545, in which hares
were catching and roasting sportsmen. In 1546, possibly under
Italian influence, Cranach composed the &ldquo;Fons Juventutis&rdquo;
of the Berlin Gallery, executed by his son, a picture in which
hags are seen entering a Renaissance fountain, and are received
as they issue from it with all the charms of youth by knights
and pages.</p>

<p>Cranach&rsquo;s chief occupation was that of portrait-painting, and
we are indebted to him chiefly for the preservation of the features
of all the German Reformers and their princely adherents. But
he sometimes condescended to depict such noted followers of the
papacy as Albert of Brandenburg, archbishop elector of Mainz,
Anthony Granvelle and the duke of Alva. A dozen likenesses
of Frederick III. and his brother John are found to bear the date
of 1532. It is characteristic of Cranach&rsquo;s readiness, and a proof
that he possessed ample material for mechanical reproduction,
that he received payment at Wittenberg in 1533. for &ldquo;sixty
pairs of portraits of the elector and his brother&rdquo; in one day.
Amongst existing likenesses we should notice as the best that of
Albert, elector of Mainz, in the Berlin museum, and that of John,
elector of Saxony, at Dresden.</p>

<p>Cranach had three sons, all artists:&mdash;John Lucas, who died
at Bologna in 1536; Hans Cranach, whose life is obscure; and
Lucas, born in 1515, who died in 1586.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRANBERRY,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> the fruit of plants of the genus <i>Oxycoccus</i>,
(natural order Vacciniaceae), often considered part of the genus
<i>Vaccinium. O. palustris</i> (or <i>Vaccinium Oxycoccus</i>), the common
cranberry plant, is found in marshy land in northern and central
Europe and North America. Its stems are wiry, creeping and
of varying length; the leaves are evergreen, dark and shining
above, glaucous below, revolute at the margin, ovate, lanceolate
or elliptical in shape, and not more than half an inch long; the
flowers, which appear in May or June, are small and stalked, and
have a four-lobed, rose-tinted corolla, purplish filaments, and
anther-cells forming two long tubes. The berries ripen in August
and September; they are pear-shaped and about the size of
currants, are crimson in colour and often spotted, and have
an acid and astringent taste. The American species, <i>O. macrocarpus</i>,
is found wild from Maine to the Carolinas. It attains a
greater size than <i>O. palustris</i>, and bears bigger and finer berries,
which are of three principal sorts, the <i>cherry</i> or round, the <i>bugle</i>
or oblong, and the <i>pear</i> or bell-shaped, and vary in hue from
light pink to dark purple, or may be mottled red and white.
<i>O. erythrocarpus</i> is a species indigenous in the mountains from
Virginia to Georgia, and is remarkable for the excellent flavour
of its berry.</p>

<p>Air and moisture are the chief requisites for the thriving of the
cranberry plant. It is cultivated in America on a soil of peat or
vegetable mould, free from loam and clay, and cleared of turf,
and having a surface layer of clean sand. The sand, which needs
renewal every two or three years, is necessary for the vigorous
existence of the plants, and serves both to keep the underlying
soil cool and damp, and to check the growth of grass and weeds.
The ground must be thoroughly drained, and should be provided
with a supply of water and a dam for flooding the plants during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
winter to protect them from frost, and occasionally at other
seasons to destroy insect pests; but the use of spring water
should be avoided. The flavour of the fruit is found to be
improved by growing the plants in a soil enriched with well-rotted
dung, and by supplying them with less moisture than they
obtain in their natural habitats. Propagation is effected by
means of cuttings, of which the wood should be wiry in texture,
and the leaves of a greenish-brown colour. In America, where,
in the vicinity of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the cultivation of the
cranberry commenced early in the last century, wide tracts of
waste land have been utilized for that purpose&mdash;low, easily
flooded, marshy ground, worth originally not more than from
$10 to $20 an acre, having been made to yield annually $200 or
$300 worth of the fruit per acre. The yield varies between 50
and 400 bushels an acre, but 100 bushels, or about 35 barrels,
is estimated to be the average production when the plants
have begun to bear well. The approximate cranberry crop of
the United States from 1890 to 1899 varied from 410,000 to
1,000,000 bushels.</p>

<p>Cranberries should be gathered when ripe and dry, otherwise
they do not keep well. The darkest-coloured berries are those
which are most esteemed. The picking of the fruit begins in New
Jersey in October, at the close of the blackberry and whortleberry
season, and often lasts until the coming in of cold weather.
From 3 to 4 bushels a day may be collected by good workers.
New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore are the leading
American markets for cranberries, whence they are exported to
the West Indies, England and France in great quantities.
England was formerly supplied by Lincolnshire and Norfolk
with abundance of the common cranberry, which it now largely
imports from Sweden and Russia. The fruit is much used for
pies and tarts, and also for making an acid summer beverage.
The cowberry, or red whortleberry, <i>Vaccinium Vitis-Idaea</i>, is
sometimes sold for the cranberry. The Tasmanian and the
Australian cranberries are the produce respectively of <i>Astroloma
humifusum</i> and <i>Lissanthe sapida</i>, plants of the order <i>Epacridaceae</i>.</p>

Cranberry Growers&rsquo; Association</i> (Trenton, N. J.). There is a good

of</span> (1814-1906), British statesman, was born at Bradford on
the 1st of October 1814, the son of John Hardy, and belonged to
a Yorkshire family. Entering upon active political life in 1847,
eleven years after his graduation at Oxford, and nine years after
his call to the bar, he offered himself as a candidate for Bradford,
but was unsuccessful. In 1856 he was returned for Leominster, and
in 1865 defeated Mr Gladstone at Oxford. In 1866 he became
president of the Poor Law Board in Lord Derby&rsquo;s new administration.
When in 1867 Mr Walpole resigned, from dissatisfaction
with Mr Disraeli&rsquo;s Reform Bill, Mr Hardy succeeded him at
the home office. In 1874 he was secretary for war; and when in
1878 Lord Salisbury took the foreign office upon the resignation
of Lord Derby, Viscount Cranbrook (as Mr Hardy became
within a month afterwards) succeeded him at the India office.
At the same time he had assumed the additional family surname
of Gathorne, which had been that of his mother. In Lord
Salisbury&rsquo;s administrations of 1885 and 1886 Lord Cranbrook
was president of the council, and upon his retirement from
public life concurrently with the resignation of the cabinet in
1892 he was raised to an earldom. He died on the 30th of
October 1906, being succeeded as 2nd earl by his son John
Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, previously known as Lord Medway
(b. 1839), who from 1868 to 1880 sat in parliament as a conservative
for Rye, and from 1884 to 1892 for a division of Kent.</p>

the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway from Paddock Wood.
Pop. (1901) 3949. It lies on the Crane brook, a feeder of the
river Beult, in a pleasant district, hilly and well wooded. It has
a fine church (mainly Perpendicular) dedicated to St Dunstan,
which is remarkable for a baptistery, built in the early part of the
18th century, and some ancient stained glass. As the centre of
the agricultural district of the Kentish Weald, it carries on an
extensive trade in malt, hops and general goods; but its present
condition is in striking contrast to the activity it displayed from
the 14th to the 17th century, when it was one of the principal
seats of the broadcloth manufacture. Remains of some of the
old factories still exist. The town has a grammar school of
Elizabethan foundation, which now ranks as one of the
smaller public schools. In the neighbourhood are the ruins of

<p><span class="bold">CRANDALL, PRUDENCE<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (1803-1889), American school-teacher,
was born, of Quaker parentage, at Hopkinton, Rhode
Island, on the 3rd of September 1803. She was educated in the
Friends&rsquo; school at Providence, R. I., taught school at Plainfield,
Conn., and in 1831 established a private academy for girls at
Canterbury, Windham county, Connecticut. By admitting a
negro girl she lost her white patrons, and in March 1833, on the
advice of William Lloyd Garrison and Samuel J. May (1797-1871),
she opened a school for &ldquo;young ladies and little misses of
colour.&rdquo; For this she was bitterly denounced, not only in Canterbury
but throughout Connecticut, and was persecuted, boycotted
and socially ostracized; measures were taken in the Canterbury
town-meeting to break up the school, and finally in May 1833 the
state legislature passed the notorious Connecticut &ldquo;Black Law,&rdquo;
prohibiting the establishment of schools for non-resident negroes
in any city or township of Connecticut, without the consent of the
local authorities. Miss Crandall, refusing to submit, was arrested,
tried and convicted in the lower courts, whose verdict, however,
was reversed on a technicality by the court of appeals in July 1834.
Thereupon the local opposition to her redoubled, and she was
finally in September 1834 forced to close her school. Soon
afterward she married the Rev. Calvin Philleo. She died at Elk
Falls, Kansas, on the 28th of January 1889. The Connecticut
Black Law was repealed in 1838. Miss Crandall&rsquo;s attempt to
educate negro girls at Canterbury attracted the attention of the
whole country; and the episode is of considerable significance as
showing the attitude of a New England community toward the
negro at that time.</p>

educated at Lafayette College and Syracuse University. His
first story, <i>Maggie, a Girl of the Streets</i>, was published in 1891,
but his greatest success was made with <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>
(1896), a brilliant and highly realistic, though of course imaginary,
description of the experiences of a private in the Civil War. He
was also the author of various other stories, and acted as a war
correspondent in the Greco-Turkish War (1897) and the Spanish
American War (1898). His health became seriously affected in
Cuba, and on his return he settled down in England. He died

<p><span class="bold">CRANE, WALTER<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1845-&emsp;&emsp;), English artist, second son
of Thomas Crane, portrait painter and miniaturist, was born
in Liverpool on the 15th of August 1845. The family soon
removed to Torquay, where the boy gained his early artistic
impressions, and, when he was twelve years old, to London. He
early came under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, and was
a diligent student of Ruskin. A set of coloured page designs
to illustrate Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lady of Shalott&rdquo; gained the approval
of William James Linton, the wood-engraver, to whom Walter
Crane was apprenticed for three years (1859-1862). As a wood-engraver
he had abundant opportunity for the minute study of
the contemporary artists whose work passed through his hands,
of Rossetti, Millais, Tenniel and F. Sandys, and of the masters
of the Italian Renaissance, but he was more influenced by the
Elgin marbles in the British Museum. A further and important
element in the development of his talent, was the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
Japanese colour-prints, the methods of which he imitated in a
series of toy-books, which started a new fashion. In 1862 a
picture of his, &ldquo;The Lady of Shalott,&rdquo; was exhibited at the
Royal Academy, but the Academy steadily refused his maturer
work; and after the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877
he ceased to send pictures to Burlington House. In 1864 he
began to illustrate for Mr Edmund Evans, the colour printer, a
series of sixpenny toy-books of nursery rhymes, displaying
admirable fancy and beauty of design, though he was limited
to the use of three colours. He was allowed more freedom in a
delightful series begun in 1873, <i>The Frog Prince, &amp;c.</i>, which showed
markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to
Italy following on his marriage in 1871. <i>The Baby&rsquo;s Opera</i> was
a book of English nursery songs planned in 1877 with Mr Evans,
and a third series of children&rsquo;s books with the collective title,
<i>A Romance of the Three R&rsquo;s</i>, provided a regular course of instruction
in art for the nursery. In his early &ldquo;Lady of Shalott&rdquo; the
artist had shown his preoccupation with unity of design in book
illustration by printing in the words of the poem himself, in the
view that this union of the calligrapher&rsquo;s and the decorator&rsquo;s art
was one secret of the beauty of the old illuminated books. He
followed the same course in <i>The First of May: A Fairy Masque</i>
by his friend John R. Wise, text and decoration being in this
case reproduced by photogravure. The &ldquo;Goose Girl&rdquo; illustration
taken from his beautiful <i>Household Stories from Grimm</i>
(1882) was reproduced in tapestry by William Morris, and is
now in the South Kensington Museum. <i>Flora&rsquo;s Feast, A Masque
of Flowers</i> had lithographic reproductions of Mr Crane&rsquo;s line
drawings washed in with water colour; he also decorated in
colour <i>The Wonder Book</i> of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret
Deland&rsquo;s <i>Old Garden</i>; in 1894 he collaborated with William
Morris in the page decoration of <i>The Story of the Glittering Plain</i>,
published at the Kelmscott press, which was executed in the
style of 16th-century Italian and German woodcuts; but in
purely decorative interest the finest of his works in book illustration
is Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queene</i> (12 pts., 1894-1896) and the
<i>Shepheard&rsquo;s Calendar</i>. The poems which form the text of <i>Queen
Summer</i> (1891), <i>Renascence</i> (1891), and <i>The Sirens Three</i> (1886)
are by the artist himself.</p>

<p>In the early &rsquo;eighties under Morris&rsquo;s influence he was closely
associated with the Socialist movement. He did as much as
Morris himself to bring art into the daily life of all classes. With
this object in view he devoted much attention to designs for
textile stuffs, for wall-papers, and to house decoration; but he
also used his art for the direct advancement of the Socialist
cause. For a long time he provided the weekly cartoons for the
Socialist organs, <i>Justice</i> and <i>The Commonweal</i>. Many of these
were collected as <i>Cartoons for the Cause</i>. He devoted much time
and energy to the work of the Art Workers&rsquo; Guild, and to the
Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, founded by him in 1888.
His own easel pictures, chiefly allegorical in subject, among them
&ldquo;The Bridge of Life&rdquo; (1884) and &ldquo;The Mower&rdquo; (1891), were
exhibited regularly at the Grosvenor Gallery and later at the
New Gallery. &ldquo;Neptune&rsquo;s Horses,&rdquo; which, with many other of
Mr Crane&rsquo;s pictures, came into the possession of Herr Ernst
Seeger of Berlin, was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1893, and
with it may be classed his &ldquo;The Rainbow and the Wave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His varied work includes examples of plaster relief, tiles,
stained glass, pottery, wall-paper and textile designs, in all of
which he applied the principle that in purely decorative design
&ldquo;the artist works freest and best without direct reference to
nature, and should have learned the forms he makes use of by
heart.&rdquo; An exhibition of his work of different kinds was held
at the Fine Art Society&rsquo;s galleries in Bond Street in 1891, and
taken over to the United States in the same year by the artist
himself. It was afterwards exhibited in the chief German,
Austrian and Scandinavian towns, arousing great interest
throughout the continent.</p>

<p>Mr Crane became an associate of the Water Colour Society
in 1888; he was an examiner of the science and art department
at South Kensington; director of design at the Manchester
Municipal school (1894); art director of Reading College (1896);
and in 1898 for a short time principal of the Royal College of Art.
His lectures at Manchester were published with illustrated
drawings as <i>The Bases of Design</i> (1898) and <i>Line and Form</i> (1900).
<i>The Decorative Illustration of Books, Old and New</i> (2nd ed.,
London and New York, 1900) is a further contribution to theory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRANE, WILLIAM HENRY<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1845-&emsp;&emsp;), American actor,
was born on the 30th of April 1845, in Leicester, Massachusetts,
and made his first appearance at Utica, New York, in Donizetti&rsquo;s
<i>Daughter of the Regiment</i> in 1863. Later he had a great success
as Le Blanc the Notary, in the burlesque <i>Evangeline</i> (1873). He
made his first hit in the legitimate drama with Stuart Robson
(1836-1903), in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and other Shakespearian
plays, and in <i>The Henrietta</i> (1881) by Bronson Howard (1842-1908).
This partnership lasted for twelve years, and subsequently
Crane appeared in various eccentric character parts in
such plays as <i>The Senator</i> and <i>David Harum</i>. In 1904 he turned
to more serious work and played Isidore Izard in <i>Business is
Business</i>, an adaptation from Octave Mirbeau&rsquo;s <i>Les Affaires
sont les affaires</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRANE<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (in Dutch, <i>Kraan</i>; O. Ger. <i>Kraen</i>; cognate, as also
the Lat. <i>grus</i>, and consequently the Fr. <i>grue</i> and Span. <i>grulla</i>,
with the Gr. <span class="grk" title="geranos">&#947;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>), the <i>Grus communis</i> or <i>G. cinerea</i> of
ornithologists, one of the largest wading-birds, and formerly a
native of England, where William Turner, in 1544, said that he
had very often seen its young (&ldquo;<i>earum pipiones saepissime vidi</i>&rdquo;).
Notwithstanding the protection afforded it by sundry acts of
parliament, it has long since ceased from breeding in England.
Sir T. Browne (ob. 1682) speaks of it as being found in the open
parts of Norfolk in winter. In Ray&rsquo;s time it was only known as
occurring at the same season in large flocks in the fens of Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire; and though mention is made of cranes&rsquo;
eggs and young in the fen-laws passed at a court held at Revesby
in 1780, this was most likely but the formal repetition of an
older edict; for in 1768 Pennant wrote that after the strictest
inquiry he found the inhabitants of those counties to be wholly
unacquainted with the bird. The crane, however, no doubt
then appeared in Britain, as it does now, at uncertain intervals
and in unwonted places, having strayed from the migrating
bands whose movements have been remarked from almost the
earliest ages. Indeed, the crane&rsquo;s aerial journeys are of a very
extended kind; and on its way from beyond the borders of the
Tropic of Cancer to within the Arctic Circle, or on the return
voyage, its flocks may be descried passing overhead at a
marvellous height, or halting for rest and refreshment on the
wide meadows that border some great river, while the seeming
order with which its ranks are marshalled during flight has long
attracted attention. The crane takes up its winter quarters
under the burning sun of Central Africa and India, but early in
spring returns northward. Not a few examples reach the chill
polar soils of Lapland and Siberia, but some tarry in the south
of Europe and breed in Spain, and, it is supposed, in Turkey.
The greater number, however, occupy the intermediate zone and
pass the summer in Russia, north Germany, and Scandinavia.
Soon after their arrival in these countries the flocks break up into
pairs, whose nuptial ceremonies are accompanied by loud and
frequent trumpetings, and the respective breeding-places of each
are chosen.</p>

<p>The nest is formed with little art on the ground in large open
marshes, where the herbage is not very high&mdash;a tolerably dry
spot being selected and used apparently year after year. Here
the eggs, which are of a rich brown colour with dark spots, and
always two in number, are laid. The young are able to run soon
after they are hatched, and are at first clothed with tawny down.
In the course of the summer they assume nearly the same grey
plumage that their parents wear, except that the elongated
plumes, which in the adults form a graceful covering of the hinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
parts of the body, are comparatively undeveloped, and the clear
black, white and red (the last being due to a patch of papillose
skin of that colour) of the head and neck are as yet indistinct.
During this time they keep in the marshes, but as autumn
approaches the different families unite by the rivers and lakes,
and ultimately form the enormous bands which after much more
trumpeting set out on their southward journey.</p>

<p>The crane&rsquo;s power of uttering its sonorous and peculiar
trumpet-like notes is commonly ascribed to the formation of its
trachea, which on quitting the lower end of the neck passes
backward between the branches of the furcula and is received
into a hollow space formed by the bony walls of the carina or
keel of the sternum. Herein it makes three turns, and then runs
upwards and backwards to the lungs. The apparatus on the
whole much resembles that found in the whooping swans (<i>Cygnus
musicus</i>, <i>C. buccinator</i> and others), though differing in some not
unimportant details; but at the same time somewhat similar
convolutions of the trachea occur in other birds which do not
possess, so far as is known, the faculty of trumpeting. The
crane emits its notes both during flight and while on the ground.
In the latter case the neck and bill are uplifted and the mouth
kept open during the utterance of the blast, which may be often
heard from birds in confinement, especially at the beginning of
the year.</p>

<p>As usually happens in similar cases, the name of the once
familiar British species is now used in a general sense, and applied
to all others which are allied to it. Though by former systematists
placed near or even among the herons, there is no doubt that the
cranes have only a superficial resemblance and no real affinity to
the <i>Ardeidae</i>. In fact the <i>Gruidae</i> form a somewhat isolated
group. Huxley included them together with the <i>Rallidae</i> in his
<i>Geranomorphae</i>; but a more extended view of their various
characters would probably assign them rather as relatives of the
Bustards&mdash;not that it must be thought that the two families have
not been for a very long time distinct. <i>Grus</i>, indeed, is a very
ancient form, its remains appearing in the Miocene of France and
Greece, as well as in the Pliocene and Post-pliocene of North
America. In France, too, during the &ldquo;Reindeer Period&rdquo;
there existed a huge species&mdash;the <i>G. primigenia</i> of Alphonse
Milne-Edwards&mdash;which has doubtless been long extinct. At the
present time cranes inhabit all the great zoogeographical regions
of the earth, except the Neotropical, and some sixteen or seventeen
species are discriminated. In Europe, besides the <i>G. communis</i>
already mentioned, the Numidian or demoiselle-crane (<i>G. virgo</i>) is
distinguished from every other by its long white ear-tufts. This
bird is also widely distributed throughout Asia and Africa, and is
said to have occurred in Orkney as a straggler. The eastern part
of the Palaearctic Region is inhabited by four other species that
do not frequent Europe (<i>G. antigone</i>, <i>G. japonensis</i>, <i>G. monachus</i>,
and <i>G. leucogeranus</i>), of which the last is perhaps the finest of the
family, with nearly the whole plumage of a snowy white. The
Indian Region, besides being visited in winter by four of the
species already named, has two that are peculiar to it (<i>G. torquata</i>
and <i>G. indica</i>, both commonly confounded under the name of
<i>G. antigone</i>). The Australian Region possesses a large species
known to the colonists as the &ldquo;native companion&rdquo; (<i>G. australis</i>),
while the Nearctic is tenanted by three species (<i>G. americana</i>,
<i>G. canadensis</i> and <i>G. fraterculus</i>), to say nothing of the possibility
of a fourth (<i>G. schlegeli</i>), a little-known and somewhat obscure
bird, finding its habitat here. In the Ethiopian Region are two
species (<i>G. paradisea</i> and <i>G. carunculata</i>), which do not occur out
of Africa, as well as three others forming the group known as
&ldquo;crowned cranes&rdquo;&mdash;differing much from other members of the
family, and justifiably placed in a separate genus, <i>Balearica</i>.
One of these (<i>B. pavonina</i>) inhabits northern and western Africa,
while another (<i>B. regulorum</i>) is confined to the eastern and
southern parts of that continent. The third (<i>B. ceciliae</i>), from
the White Nile, has been described by Dr P. Chalmers Mitchell
(<i>P.Z.S.</i>, 1904).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With regard to the literature of this species, a paper &ldquo;On the
Breeding of the Crane in Lapland&rdquo; (<i>Ibis</i>, 1859, p. 191), by John
Wolley, is one of the most pleasing contributions to natural history
ever written, and an admirably succinct account of all the different
species was communicated by Blyth to <i>The Field</i> in 1873 (vol. xl.
p. 631, vol. xli. pp. 7, 61, 136, 189, 248, 384, 408, 418). A beautiful

one of their annual migrations is to be found in Wolf&rsquo;s <i>Zoological

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRANES<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (so called from the resemblance to the long neck of the
bird, cf. Gr. <span class="grk" title="geranos">&#947;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, Fr. <i>grue</i>), machines by means of which
heavy bodies may be lifted, and also displaced horizontally, within
certain defined limits. Strictly speaking, the name alludes to the
arm or jib from which the load to be moved is suspended, but
it is now used in a wider sense to include the whole mechanism
by which a load is raised vertically and moved horizontally.
Machines used for lifting only are not called cranes, but winches,
lifts or hoists, while the term elevator or conveyor is commonly
given to appliances which continuously, not in separate loads,
move materials like grain or coal in a vertical, horizontal or
diagonal direction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conveyors</a></span>). The use of cranes is of great
antiquity, but it is only since the great industrial development of
the 19th century, and the introduction of other motive powers
than hand labour, that the crane has acquired the important
and indispensable position it now occupies. In all places where
finished goods are handled, or manufactured goods are made,
cranes of various forms are in universal use.</p>

<p>Cranes may be divided into two main classes&mdash;revolving and
non-revolving. In the first the load can be lifted vertically, and
then moved round a central pivot, so as to be deposited
at any convenient point within the range. The type of
<span class="sidenote">Classification.</span>
this class is the ordinary jib crane. In the second
class there are, in addition to the lifting motion, two horizontal
movements at right angles to one another. The type of this
class is the overhead traveller. The two classes obviously
represent respectively systems of polar and rectangular coordinates.
Jib cranes can be subdivided into fixed cranes and
portable cranes; in the former the central-post or pivot is
firmly fixed in a permanent position, while in the latter the
whole crane is mounted on wheels, so that it may be transported
from place to place.</p>

<p>The different kinds of motive power used to actuate cranes&mdash;manual,
steam, hydraulic, electric&mdash;give a further classification.
Hand cranes are extremely useful where the load is not
excessive, and the quantities to be dealt with are not
<span class="sidenote">Motive powers.</span>
great; also where speed is not important, and first cost
is an essential consideration. The net effective work of lifting
that can be performed by a man turning a handle may be taken,
for intermittent work, as being on an average about 5000 foot-lb
per minute; this is equivalent to 1 ton lifted about 2¼ ft. per
minute, so that four men can by a crane raise 1 ton 9 ft. in a
minute or 9 tons 1 ft. per minute. It is at once evident that
hand power is only suitable for cranes of moderate power, or in
cases where heavy loads have to be lifted only very occasionally.
This point is dwelt upon, because the speed limitations of the
hand-crane are often overlooked by engineers. Steam is an
extremely useful motive power for all cranes that are not worked
off a central power station. The steam crane has the immense
advantage of being completely self-contained. It can be moved
(by its own locomotive power, if desired) long distances without
requiring any complicated means of conveying power to it; and
it is rapid in work, fairly economical, and can be adapted to the
most varying circumstances. Where, however, there are a
number of cranes all belonging to the same installation, and
these are placed so as to be conveniently worked from a central
power station, and where the work is rapid, heavy and continuous,
as is the case at large ports, docks and railway or other
warehouses, experience has shown that it is best to produce the
power in a generating station and distribute it to the cranes.
Down to the closing decades of the 19th century hydraulic
power was practically the only system available for working
cranes from a power station. The hydraulic crane is rapid in
action, very smooth and silent in working, easy to handle, and
not excessive in cost or upkeep,&mdash;advantages which have secured
its adoption in every part of the world. Electricity as a motive
power for cranes is of more recent introduction. The electric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
transmission of energy can be performed with an efficiency not
reached by any other method, and the electric motor readily
adapts itself to cranes. When they are worked from a power
station the great advantage is gained that the same plant which
drives them can be used for many other purposes, such as
working machine tools and supplying current for lighting. For
dock-side jib cranes the use of electric power is making rapid
strides. For overhead travellers in workshops, and for most of
the cranes which fall into our second class, electricity as a
motive power has already displaced nearly every other method.
Cranes driven by shafting, or by mechanical power, have been
largely superseded by electric cranes, principally on account of
the much greater economy of transmission. For many years the
best workshop travellers were those driven by quick running
ropes; these performed admirable service, but they have given
place to the more modern electric traveller.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal motion in a crane is naturally the hoisting or
lifting motion. This is effected by slinging the load to an eye or
hook, and elevating the hook vertically. There are three
typical methods: (1) A direct pull may be applied to
<span class="sidenote">Lifting mechanisms.</span>
the hook, either by screws, or by a cylinder fitted with
piston and rod and actuated by direct hydraulic or other
pressure, as shown diagrammatically in fig. 1. These methods are
used in exceptional cases, but present the obvious difficulty of giving
a very short range of lift. (2) The hook may be attached to a rope
or chain, and the pulling cylinder connected with a system of pulleys
around which the rope is led; by these means the lift can be very
largely increased. Various arrangements are adopted; the one
indicated in fig. 2 gives a lift of load four times the stroke of the
cylinder. This second method forms the basis of the lifting gear in
all hydraulic cranes. (3) The lifting rope or chain is led over pulley
to a lifting barrel, upon which it is coiled as the barrel is rotated by
the source of power (fig. 3). Sometimes, especially in the case of
overhead travelling cranes for very heavy loads, the chain is a special
pitch chain, formed of flat links pinned together, and the barrel is
reduced to a wheel provided with teeth, or &ldquo;sprockets,&rdquo; which
engage in the links. In this case the chain is not coiled, but simply
passes over the lifting wheel, the free end hanging loose. All the
methods in this third category require a rotating lifting or barrel
shaft, and this is the important difference between them and the
hydraulic cranes mentioned above. Cranes fitted with rotating
hydraulic engines may be considered as coming under the third
category.</p>

<p>When the loads are heavy the above mechanisms are supplemented
by systems of purchase blocks suspended from the jib or the
traveller crab; and in barrel cranes trains of rotating gearing are
interposed between the motor, or manual handle, and the barrel
(fig. 3).</p>

<p>When a load is lifted, work has to be done in overcoming the
action of gravity and the friction of the mechanism; when it is
lowered, energy is given out. To control the speed and
absorb this energy, brakes have to be provided. The
<span class="sidenote">Brakes.</span>
hydraulic crane has a great advantage in possessing an almost ideal
brake, for by simply throttling the exhaust from the lifting cylinder
the speed of descent can be regulated within very wide limits and
with perfect safety. Barrel cranes are usually fitted with band
brakes, consisting of a brake rim with a friction band placed round
it, the band being tightened as required. In ordinary cases conduction
and convection suffice to dissipate the heat generated by the
brake, but when a great deal of lowering has to be rapidly performed,
or heavy loads have to be lowered to a great depth, special arrangements
have to be provided. An excellent brake for very large cranes
is Matthew&rsquo;s hydraulic brake, in which water is passed from end to
end of cylinders fitted with reciprocating pistons, cooling jackets
being provided. In electric cranes a useful method is to arrange
the connexions so that the lifting motor acts as a dynamo, and,
driven by the energy of the falling load, generates a current which
is converted into heat by being passed through resistances. That
the quantity of heat to be got rid of may become very considerable
is seen when it is considered that the energy of a load of 60 tons
descending through 50 ft. is equivalent to an amount of heat sufficient
to raise nearly 6 gallons of water from 60° F. to boiling point. Crane
brakes are usually under the direct control of the driver, and they are
generally arranged in one of two ways. In the first, the pressure
is applied by a handle or treadle, and is removed by a spring or
weight; this is called &ldquo;braking on.&rdquo; In the second, or &ldquo;braking
off&rdquo; method, the brake is automatically applied by a spring or
weight, and is released either mechanically or, in the case of electric
cranes, by the pull of a solenoid or magnet which is energized by the
current passing through the motor. When the motor starts the
brake is released; when it stops, or the current ceases, the brake
goes on. The first method is in general use for steam cranes; it
allows for a far greater range of power in the brake, but is not
automatic, as is the second.</p>

<p>In free-barrel cranes the lifting barrel is connected to the revolving
shaft by a powerful friction clutch; this, when interlocked with
the brake and controller, renders electric cranes exceedingly rapid
in working, as the barrel can be detached and lowering performed
at a very high speed, without waiting for the lifting motor to come
to rest in order to be reversed. This method of working is very
suitable for electric dock-side cranes of capacities up to about 5 or
7 tons, and for overhead travellers where the height of lift is
moderate. Where high speed lowering is not required it is usual to
employ a reversing motor and keep it always in gear.</p>

<p>In steam cranes it is usual to work all the motions from one double
cylinder engine. In order to enable two or more motions to be
worked together, or independently as required, reversing friction
cones are used for the subsidiary motions, especially the slewing
motion. With the exception of a few special cranes in which friction
wheels are employed, it is universally the practice, in steam cranes,
to connect the engine shaft with the barrel shaft by spur toothed
gearing, the gear being connected or disconnected by sliding pinions.
In electric cranes the motor is connected to the barrel, either in a
similar manner by spur gear or by worm gear. The toothed wheels
give a slightly better efficiency, but the worm gear is somewhat
smoother in its action and entirely silent; the noise of gearing can,
however, be considerably reduced by careful machining of the teeth,
as is now always done, and also by the use of pinions made of rawhide
leather or other non-resonant material. When quick-running
metal pinions are used they are arranged to run in closed oil-baths.
Leather pinions must be protected from rats, which eat them freely.
Worm wheel gearing is of very high efficiency if made very quick in
pitch, with properly formed teeth perfectly lubricated, and with
the end thrust of the worm taken on ball bearings. Much attention
has been paid to the improvement of the mechanical details of the
lifting and other motions of cranes, and in important installations
the gearing is now usually made of cast steel. In revolving cranes
ease of slewing can be greatly increased by the use of a live ring of
conical rollers.</p>

<p>Electric motors for barrel cranes are not essentially different from
those used for other purposes, but in proportioning the sizes the
intermittent output has to be taken into consideration.
This fact has led to the introduction of the &ldquo;crane rated&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Power required.</span>
motor, with a given &ldquo;load factor.&rdquo; This latter gives the
ratio of the length of the working periods to the whole time; <i>e.g.</i>
a motor rated for a quarter load factor means that the motor is
capable of exerting its full normal horse-power for three minutes
out of every twelve, the pause being nine minutes, or one minute
out of every four, the pause being three minutes. The actual load
factor to be chosen depends on the nature of the work and the kind
of crane. A dock-side crane unloading cargo with high lifts following
one another in rapid succession will require a higher load factor
than a workshop traveller with a very short lift and only a very
occasional maximum load; and a traveller with a very long longitudinal
travel will require a higher load factor for the travelling
motor than for the lifting motor. In practice, the load factor for
electric crane motors varies from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>. In steam cranes much the
same principle obtains in proportioning the boiler; <i>e.g.</i> the engines
of a 10-ton steam crane have cylinders capable of indicating about
60 horse-power when working at full speed, but it is found that, in
consequence of the intermittent working, sufficient steam can be
supplied with a boiler whose heating surface is only <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> to ¼ of that
necessary for the above power, when developed continuously by a
stationary engine.</p>

<p>In well-designed, quick-running cranes the mechanical efficiency
of the lifting gear may be taken as about 85%; a good electric jib
crane will give an efficiency of 72%, <i>i.e.</i> when actually lifting at
full speed the mechanical work of lifting represents about 72% of
the electric energy put into the lifting motor. A very convenient
rule is to allow one brake horse-power of motor for every 10 foot-tons
of work done at the hook: this is equivalent to an efficiency
of 66<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>%, and is well on the safe side.</p>

<p>The motor in most common use for electric cranes is the series
wound, continuous current motor, which has many advantages.
It has a very large starting torque, which enables it to overcome the
inertia of getting the load into motion, and it lifts heavy loads at a
slower speed and lighter loads at a quicker one, behaving, under the
action of the controller in a somewhat similar manner to that in
which the cylinders of the steam crane respond to the action of
the stop-valve. Three-phase motors are also much used for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
crane-driving, and it is probable that improvements in single and
two-phase motors will eventually largely increase their use for this
class of work.</p>

<p>Tests of the comparative efficiencies of hydraulic and electric
cranes tend to show that, although they do not vary to any very
considerable extent with full load, yet the efficiency of the hydraulic
crane falls away very much more rapidly than that of the electric
crane when working on smaller loads. This drawback can be
corrected to a slight extent by furnishing the hydraulic crane with
more than one cylinder, and thus compounding it, but the arrangement
does not give the same economical range of load as in an
electric crane. In first cost the hydraulic crane has the advantage,
but the power mains are much less expensive and more convenient
to arrange in the electric crane.</p>

<p>The limit of speed of lift of hand cranes has already been mentioned;
for steam jib cranes average practice is represented by the
formula V = 30 + 200/T, where V is the speed of lift in
feet per minute, and T the load in tons. Where electric
<span class="sidenote">Speed.</span>
or hydraulic cranes are worked from a central station the speed is
greater, and may be roughly represented by V = 5 + 300/T; <i>e.g.</i> a
30-cwt. crane would lift with a speed of about 200 ft. per minute,
and 100-ton crane with a speed of about 8 ft. per minute, but these
speeds vary with local circumstances. The lifting speed of electric
travellers is generally less, because the lift is generally much shorter,
and may in ordinary cases be taken as V = 3 + 85/T. The cross-traversing
speed of travellers varies from 60 to 120 ft. per minute,
and the longitudinal from 100 to 300 ft. per minute. The speed of
these two motions depends much on the length of the span and of the
longitudinal run, and on the nature of the work to be done; in
certain cases, <i>e.g.</i> foundries, it is desirable to be able to lift, on
occasions, at an extremely slow speed. In addition to the brakes
on the lifting gear of cranes it is found necessary, especially in quick-running
electric cranes, to provide a brake on the subsidiary
motions, and also devices to stop the motor at the end of the lift
or travel, so as to prevent over-running.</p>

<p>There are many other important points of crane construction too
numerous to mention here, but it may be said generally that the
advent of electricity has tended to increase speeds, and in consequence
great attention is paid to all details that reduce friction and
wear, such as roller and ball bearings and improved methods of
lubrication; and, as in all other quick-running machinery, great
stress has to be laid on accuracy of workmanship. The machinery,
thus being of a higher class, requires more protection, and cranes
that work in the open are now fitted with elaborate crane-houses or
cabins, furnished with weather-tight doors and windows, and more
care is taken to provide proper platforms, hand-rails and ladders
of access, and also guards for the revolving parts of gearing.</p>

<p><i>Typical Forms of Cranes.</i>&mdash;Fig. 4 is a diagram of a fixed hand
revolving jib crane, of moderate size, as used in railway goods yards
and similar places. It consists of a heavy base, which is
securely bolted to the foundation, and which carries the
<span class="sidenote">Fixed Cranes.</span>
strong crane-post, or pillar, around which the crane revolves.
The revolving part is made with two side frames of cast
iron or steel plates, and to these the lifting gear is attached. The
load is suspended from the crane jib; this jib is attached at the
lower end to the side frames, and the upper end is supported by tie-rods,
connected to the framework, the whole revolving together.
This simple form of crane thus embodies the essential elements of
foundation, post, framework, jib, tie-rods and gearing.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows another type of fixed crane, known as a derrick crane.
Here the crane-post is extended into a long mast and is furnished
with pivots at the top and bottom; the mast is supported by two
&ldquo;back ties,&rdquo; and these are connected to the socket of the bottom
pivot by the &ldquo;sleepers.&rdquo; This is a very good and comparatively
cheap form of crane, where a long and variable radius is required,
but it cannot slew through a complete circle. Derrick cranes are
made of all powers, from the timber 1-ton hand derrick to the steel
150-ton derrick used in shipbuilding yards. The derrick crane
introduces a problem for which many solutions have been sought,
that of preventing the load from being lifted or lowered when the
jib is pivoted up or down to alter the radius. To keep the load
level, there are various devices for automatically coupling the jib-raising
and the load-lowering motions.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 340px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:290px; height:213px" src="images/img370b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Somewhat allied to the derrick are the sheer legs (fig. 6). Here
the place of the jib is taken by two inclined legs joined together
at the top and pivoted at the bottom; a third back-leg is connected
at the top to the other two, and at the bottom is coupled to a nut
which runs on a long horizontal screw. This horizontal movement
of the lower end of the back
leg allows the whole arrangement
to assume the position
shown in fig. 7, so that a
load can be taken out of a
vessel and deposited on a
quay wall. The same effect
can be produced by shortening
the back leg by a screw
placed in the direction of its
length. Sheer legs are generally
built in very large sizes,
and their use is practically
confined to marine work.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span></td>
<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Another type of fixed crane
is the &ldquo;Fairbairn&rdquo; crane,
shown in fig. 8. Here the jib, superstructure and post are all united
in one piece, which revolves in a foundation well, being supported at
the bottom by a toe-step and near the ground level by horizontal
rollers. This type of crane used to be in great favour, in consequence
of the great clearance it gives under the jib, but it is expensive and
requires very heavy foundations.</p>

<p>The so-called &ldquo;hammer-headed&rdquo; crane (fig. 9) consists of a steel
braced tower, on which revolves a large horizontal double cantilever;
the forward part of this cantilever or jib carries the lifting
crab, and the jib is extended backwards in order to form a support
for the machinery and counter-balance. Besides the motions of
lifting and revolving, there is provided a so-called &ldquo;racking&rdquo;
motion, by which the lifting crab, with the load suspended, can be
moved in and out along the jib without altering the level of the load.
Such horizontal movement of the load is a marked feature of later
crane design; it first became prominent in the so-called &ldquo;Titan&rdquo;
cranes, mentioned below (fig. 14). Hammer-headed cranes are
generally constructed in large sizes, up to 200 tons.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span></td>
<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Another type of fixed revolving crane is the foundry or smithy
crane (fig. 10). It has the horizontal racking motion mentioned
above, and revolves either on upper and lower pivots supported by
the structure of the workshop, or on a fixed pillar secured to a heavy
foundation. The type is often used in foundries, or to serve heavy
hammers in a smithy, whence the name.</p>

<p>Portable cranes are of many kinds. Obviously, nearly every
kind of crane can be made portable by mounting it on a carriage,
fitted with wheels; it is even not unusual to make the
<span class="sidenote">Portable cranes.</span>
Scottish derrick portable by using three trucks, one under
the mast, and the others under the two back legs.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 represents a portable steam jib crane; it contains the
same elements as the fixed crane (fig. 4), but the foundation bed
is mounted on a truck which is carried on railway or road wheels.
With portable cranes means must be provided to ensure the requisite
stability against overturning; this is done by weighting the tail of
the revolving part with heavy weights, and in steam cranes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
boiler is so placed as also to form part of the counterbalance. Where
the rail-gauge is narrow and great weight is not desired, blocking
girders are provided across the under side of the truck; these are
arranged so that, by means of wedges or screws, they can be made
to increase the base. In connexion with the stability of portable
cranes, it may be mentioned that accidents more often arise from
overturning backwards than forwards. In the latter case the overturning
tendency begins as soon as the load leaves the ground, but
ceases as soon as the load again touches the ground and thus relieves
the crane of the extra weight, whereas overturning backwards is
caused either by the reaction of a chain breaking or by excessive
counterweight. When portable cranes are fitted with springs and
axle-boxes, drawgear and
buffers, so that they can be
coupled to an ordinary railway
train, they are called &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;
or &ldquo;wrecking&rdquo; cranes.</p>

<p>Dock-side jib cranes for
working general cargo are
almost always made portable,
in order to enable them to be
placed in correct position in
regard to the hatchways of
the vessels which they serve.
Fig. 12 shows an ordinary
hydraulic dock-side jib crane.
This type is usually fitted with
a very high jib, so as to lift
goods in and out of high-sided
vessels. The hydraulic lifting
cylinders are placed inside the
revolving steel mast or post,
and the cabin for the driver
is arranged high up in the front
of the post, so as to give a good
view of the work. The pressure is conveyed to the crane by means of
jointed &ldquo;walking&rdquo; pipes, or flexible hose, connected to hydrants
placed at regular intervals along the quay. It is often very desirable
to have the quay space as little obstructed by the cranes as possible,
so as not to interfere with railway traffic; this has led to the introduction
of cranes mounted on high trucks or gantries, sometimes
also called &ldquo;portal&rdquo; cranes. Where warehouses or station buildings
run parallel to the quay line, the high truck is often extended, so
as to span the whole quay; on one side the &ldquo;long leg&rdquo; runs on a
rail at the quay edge, and on the other the &ldquo;short leg&rdquo; runs on a
runway placed on the building. Cranes of this type are called
&ldquo;half-portal&rdquo; cranes. Fig. 13 shows an electric crane of this class.
They give the minimum of
interference with quay space
and have rapidly come into
favour. Where the face of the
warehouse is sufficiently close
to the water to permit of the
crane rope plumbing the hatches
without requiring a jib of excessive
radius, it is a very
convenient plan to place the
whole crane on the warehouse
roof.</p>

<p>A special form of jib crane,
designed to meet a particular
purpose, is the &ldquo;Titan&rdquo; (fig. 14) largely used in the construction of
piers and breakwaters. It contains all the essential elements of the
hammer-headed crane, of which it may be considered to be the parent;
in fact, the only essential difference is that the Titan is portable and
the hammer-head crane fixed. The Titan was the first type of large
portable crane in which full use was made of a truly horizontal
movement of the load; for the purpose for which the type is designed,
viz. setting concrete blocks in courses, this motion is almost
a necessity.</p>

<p>As types of non-revolving cranes, fig. 15 shows an overhead
traveller worked by hand, and fig. 16 a somewhat similar machine
worked by electric power. The principal component
parts of a traveller are the main cross girders forming the
<span class="sidenote">Non-revolving cranes.</span>
<i>bridge</i>, the two <i>end carriages</i> on which the bridge rests, the
<i>running wheels</i> which enable the end carriages to travel
on the longitudinal gantry girders or <i>runway</i>, and the <i>crab</i> or <i>jenny</i>,
which carries the hoisting mechanism, and moves across the span on
rails placed on the bridge girders. There are numerous and important
variations of these two types, but the above contain the elements
out of which most cranes of the class are built.</p>

<p>One variation is illustrated in fig. 17, and is called a &ldquo;Goliath&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Wellington.&rdquo; It is practically a traveller mounted on high
legs, so as to permit of its being travelled on rails placed on the
ground level, instead of on an elevated gantry. Of other variations
and combinations of types, fig.
18 shows a modern design of
crane intended to command the
maximum of yard space, and
having some of the characteristics
both of the Goliath and
of the revolving jib crane, and
fig. 19 depicts a combination of
a traveller and a hanging jib
crane.</p>

<p>When the cross traverse
motion of a traveller crab is
suppressed, and the longitudinal
travelling motion is increased
in importance we come to a
type of crane, the use of which
is rapidly increasing; it goes by the name of &ldquo;transporter.&rdquo;
Transporters can only move the load to any point on a vertical
<span class="sidenote">Transporters.</span>
surface (generally a plane surface); they have a lifting
motion and a movement of translation. They are of two
kinds: (1) those in which the motive power and lifting
gear are self-contained on the crab; and (2) those in which the motive
power is placed in a fixed position. A transporter of the first class is
shown in fig. 20. From the
lower flange of a suspended
runway, made of a single I
section, run wheels, from the
axles of which the transporter
is suspended. The
latter consists of a framework
carrying the hoisting
barrel, with its driving motor
and gearing, and a travelling
motor, which is geared to the
running wheels in such a
manner as to be able to
propel the whole machine;
a seat is provided for the
driver who manipulates the controllers. A transporter of this kind,
when fitted with a grab, is a very efficient machine for taking coal
from barges and depositing it in a coal store.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 335px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:285px; height:191px" src="images/img372a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 21.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>In the other class of transporter the load is not usually moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
through such long distances. It consists essentially of a jib made
of single I-sections, and supported by tie-rods (fig. 21), the load to be
lifted being suspended from a small travelling carriage which runs
on the lower flange. The lifting gear is located in any convenient
fixed position. In order that
only one motor may be used,
and also that the load may be
lifted by a single part of rope,
various devices have been invented.
The jib is usually inclined,
so as to enable the
travel to be performed by
gravity in one direction, and
the object of the transporter
mechanism is to ensure that
pulling in or slacking out the
lifting rope shall perform the
cycle of operations in the
following order:&mdash;Supposing the load is ready to be lifted out of
a vessel on to a quay, the pull of the lifting rope raises the load, the
travelling jenny being meanwhile locked in position. On arriving
at a certain height the lift ceases and the jenny is released, and by
the continued pull of the rope, it runs up the jib; on arriving at an
adjustable stop, the jenny is again locked, and the load can be
lowered out; the hook can then be raised, when the jenny is automatically
unlocked, and on paying out the rope the jenny gravitates
to its first position, when the load is lowered and the cycle repeated.
The jibs of transporters are often made to slide forward, or lift up,
so as to be out of the way when not in use. Transporters are largely
used for dealing with general cargo between vessels and warehouses,
and also for coaling vessels; they have a great advantage in not
interfering with the rigging of vessels.</p>

<p>Nearly all recent advances in crane design are the result of the
introduction of the electric motor. It is now possible to apply
motive power exactly where it is wanted, and to do so economically,
so that the crane designer has a perfectly free hand in adding the
various motions required by the special circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>The literature which deals specially with cranes is not a large one,
but there are some good German text-books on the subject, amongst
which may be mentioned <i>Die Hebezeuge</i> by Ernst (4th ed., Berlin,
1903), and <i>Cranes</i>, by Anton Böttcher, translated with additions by
A. Tolhausen (London, 1908).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRANIOMETRY.<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> The application of precise methods of
measurement marks a definite phase in the development of most
branches of modern science, and thus craniometry, a comprehensive
expression for all methods of measuring the skull
(cranium), provides a striking landmark in the progress of
anthropological studies. The origin of craniometry appears to be
twofold. Certain artists made measurements of heads and skulls
with a view to attaining greater accuracy in their representation
of those parts of the human frame. Bernard de Palissy and
A. Dürer may be mentioned as pioneers in such researches.
Again, it is clearly shown in the literature of this subject, that
anatomists were led to employ methods of measurement in their
study of the human skull. The determining cause of this
improvement in method is curious, for it appeared at the end of a
famous anatomical controversy of the later middle ages, namely
the dispute as to whether the Galenic anatomy was based on the
study of the human body or upon those of apes. In the description
of the dissection of a chimpanzee (in 1680) Tyson explains
that the measurements he made of the skull of that animal were
devised with a view to exhibiting the difference between this and
the human skull.</p>

<p>The artists did not carry their researches very far. The
anatomists on the contrary continued to make measurements, and
in 1764 Daubenton published a noteworthy contribution to
craniometry. Six years later, Pieter Camper, distinguished both
as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures containing
an account of his craniometrical methods, and these may be
fairly claimed as having laid the foundation of all subsequent
work. That work has been described above as anthropological,
but as the studies thus defined are very varied in extent, it is
necessary to consider the subdivisions into which they naturally
fall.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:520px; height:542px" src="images/img372b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;The Skull and head of a young orang-utan, and of a negro,
showing the lines including the facial angle (MGND) devised by
Pieter Camper.</td></tr></table>

<p>In the first place (and omitting further reference to the contributions
of artists), it has been explained that the measurements
were first made with a view to elucidating the comparison of the
skulls of men with those of other animals. This wide comparison
constitutes the first subdivision of craniometric studies. And
craniometric methods have rendered the results of comparison
much more clear and comprehensible than was formerly the case.
It is further remarkable that among the first measurements
employed angular determinations occur, and indeed the name of
Camper is chiefly perpetuated in anthropological literature by the
&ldquo;facial angle&rdquo; invented by that artist-anatomist (fig. 1). It
appears impossible to improve on the simple terms in which
Camper describes the general results of the employment of this
angle for comparative purposes, as will appear from the following
brief extract from the translation of the original work: &ldquo;The
two extremities of the facial line are from 70 to 80 degrees from
the negro to the Grecian antique: make it under 70, and you
describe an ourang or an ape: lessen it still more, and you have
the head of a dog. Increase the minimum, and you form a fowl,
a snipe for example, the facial line of which is nearly parallel
with the horizon.&rdquo; (Camper&rsquo;s Works, p. 42, translated by
Cogan, 1821.)</p>

<p>In the 19th century the names of notable contributors to the
literature of craniometry quickly increase in number; while it
is impossible to analyse each contribution, or even record a
complete list of the names of the authors, it must be added that
for the purposes of far-reaching comparisons of the lower animals
with mankind, craniometric methods were used by P. P. Broca in
France and by T. H. Huxley (figs. 2 and 3) in England, with such
genius and success as have not yet been surpassed.</p>

<p>The second division of craniometric studies includes those in
which the skulls of the higher and lower races of mankind are
compared. And in this domain, the advent of accurate numerical
methods of recording observations brought about great advances.
In describing the facial angle, it will be seen that the modern
European, the Greek of classical antiquity and the Negro are
compared. Thus it is that Camper&rsquo;s name appears as that of a
pioneer in this second main division of the subject. Broca and
Huxley cultivated similar comparative racial fields of research,
but to these names that of Anders Retzius of Stockholm must be
added here. The chief claim of Retzius to distinction rests on the
merits of his system of comparing various dimensions of the
skull, and of a classification based on such comparisons. These
indices will be further defined below. It is convenient to mention
here that the first aim of all these investigators was to obtain
from the skull reliable data having reference to the conformation
or size of the brain once contained within it. Only in later days
did the tendency to overlook this, the fundamental aim and end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
of craniometry, make its appearance; such nevertheless was the
case, much to the detriment of craniometric science, which for a
time seems to have become purely empirical.</p>

<i>P.Pr.B</i>, Spheno-maxillary angle; <i>Pr.B.Op</i>, Foramina-basal angle.</td></tr></table>

<p>The third subdivision of craniometric researches is one in which
the field of comparison is still further narrowed. For herein the
various sub-racial types such as the dark and fair Europeans are
brought together for the purposes of comparison or contrast.
But although the range of research is thus narrowed and restricted,
the guiding principles and the methods remain unchanged.
In this department of craniometry, Anders Retzius
has gained the foremost place among the pioneers of research.
Retzius&rsquo;s name is, as already mentioned, associated not with any
particular angle or angular measurement, but rather with a
method of expressing as a formula two cranial dimensions
which have been measured and which are to be compared. Thus
for instance one skull may be so proportioned that its greatest
width measures 75% of its greatest length (<i>i.e.</i> its width is to its
length as three to four).</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:446px; height:207px" src="images/img373c.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>

(B) European, index 80, mesaticephalic; (C) Samoyed, index 85,
brachycephalic.</td></tr></table>

<p>This ratio (of 75%) is termed the cephalic or breadth-index,
which in such an instance would be described as equal to 75.
A skull providing a breadth-index of 75 will naturally possess
very different proportions from another which provides a corresponding
index equal to 85. And in fact this particular index in
human skulls varies from about 58 to 90 in undistorted examples
(fig. 4). Such is the general scheme of Retzius&rsquo;s system of
classification of skulls by means of indices, and one of his earliest
applications of the method was to the inhabitants of Sweden.
One striking result was to exhibit a most marked contrast in
respect of the breadth-index of the skull, between the Lapps and
their Scandinavian neighbours, and thus a craniometric difference
was added to the list of characters (such as stature, hair-colour
and complexion) whereby these two types were already distinguished.
Since the publication
of Retzius&rsquo;s studies, the cephalic or
breadth-index of the skull has
retained a premier position among
its almost innumerable successors,
though it is of historical interest to
note that, while Retzius had undoubtedly
devised the method of
comparing &ldquo;breadth-indices,&rdquo; he
always qualified the results of its
use by reference to other data.
These qualifications were overlooked
by the immediate successors
of Retzius, much to the disadvantage
of craniometry. In addition
to the researches on the skull
forms of Lapps and Swedes, others dealing with the comparison
of Finns and Swedes (by Retzius) as well as the investigation of
the form of skull in Basques and Guanches (by Broca) possess
historic interest.</p>

<p>Thus far little or nothing has been said with regard to instruments.
Camper devised a four-sided open frame with cross-wires,
through which skulls were
viewed and by means of which
accurate drawings could be projected
on to paper. The methods
of Retzius as here described
require the aid of callipers of
various sorts, and such instruments
were quickly devised and
applied to the special needs of
the case. Such instruments are
still in use, and two forms of
simple craniometer are shown in
the accompanying illustrations
(figs. 5 and 6). For the more
accurate comparison required in
the study of various European
types, delicate instruments for
measuring angles were invented
by Anthelme in Paris (1836) and
John Grattan in Belfast (1853).
These instruments enabled the observer to transmit to the plane
surface of a sheet of drawing paper a correct tracing of the contour
of the specimen under investigation. A further modification was
devised by the talented Dr Busk in the year 1861, and since that
date the number and forms of these instruments have been
greatly multiplied. With reference to contributors to the advance
of knowledge in this particular department of craniometry,
there should be added to the foregoing names those of Huxley,

Moreover, the methods
have also been multiplied,
so that in addition
to angular and linear
measurements, those of
the capacity or cubical
contents of the cranium
and those of the curvature
of its surface demand
reference. The masterly
work of Cleland claims special mention in this connexion.
And finally while two dimensions are combined in the
cephalic index of Retzius, the combination of three dimensions
(in a formula called a modulus) distinguishes some
recent work, although the employment of the modulus is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
actually a return to a system devised in 1859 by Karl E.
von Baer.</p>

<p>The fourth subdivision of craniometry is closely allied to that
which has just been described, and it deals with the comparison
of the prehistoric and the recent types of mankind. The methods
are exactly similar to those employed in the comparison of
living races; but in some particular instances where the prehistoric
individual is represented only by a comparatively minute
portion of the skull, some special modifications of the usual
procedures have been necessitated. In this field the works of
W. His and L. Rütimeyer on the prehistoric races of Switzerland,
those of Ecker (South Germany), of Broca in France, of Thurnam
and Davis in England, must be cited. G. Schwalbe, Kramberger,
W. J. Sollas and H. Klaatsch are the most recent contributors to
this department of craniometry.</p>

<p>Thus the complexity of craniometric studies has inevitably
increased. In the hands of von Török of Budapest, as in those of
M. Benedikt of Vienna at an earlier date, the number of measurements
regarded as necessary for the complete &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; of a
skull has reached a colossal total. Of the trend and progress of
craniometry at the present day, three particular developments
are noteworthy. First come the attempts made at various times
to co-ordinate the systems of measurements so as to ensure
uniformity among all observers; of these attempts two, viz. that
of the German anthropologists at Frankfort in 1882 (figs. 7 and
8), and that of the Anthropometric Committee of the British
Association (1906) seem to require at least a record. In the
second place, the application of the methods of statistical
science in dealing with large numbers of craniometric data has
been richly rewarded in Prof. Karl Pearson&rsquo;s hands. Thirdly,
and in connexion with such methods, there may be mentioned
the extension of these systems of measurement, and of the
methods of dealing with them on statistical principles, to the
study of large numbers of the skulls of domestic and feral
animals, such as white rats or the varieties of the horse. And
lastly no account of craniometry would be complete without
mention of the revolt, headed by the Italian anthropologist
Sergi, against metrical methods of all kinds. It cannot, however,
be alleged that the substitutes offered by the adherents of
Sergi&rsquo;s principles encourage others to forsake the more orthodox
numerical methods.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRANK,<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> a word of somewhat obscure etymology, probably
connected with a root meaning &ldquo;crooked,&rdquo; and appearing in the
Ger. <i>krank</i>, ill, a figurative use of the original word; among
other words in English containing the same original meaning are
&ldquo;cringe&rdquo; and &ldquo;crinkle.&rdquo; In mechanics, a crank is a device by
which reciprocating motion is converted
into circular motion or
vice versa, consisting of a <i>crank-arm</i>,
one end of which is fastened
rigidly at right angles to the
rotating shaft or axis, while the
other end bears a <i>crank-pin</i>, projecting
from it at right angles and
parallel to the shaft. When the
reciprocating part of a machine, as
the piston and piston-rod of a
steam engine, is linked to this
crank by a <i>crank-rod</i> or <i>connecting
rod</i>, one end of which works on the crank-pin and the other
on a pin in the end of the reciprocating part, the to-and-fro
motion of the latter imparts a circular motion to the shaft
and vice versa. The crank, instead of being made up as described
above, may be formed by bending the shaft to the
required shape, as sometimes in the handle of a winch. A
<i>bell-crank</i>, so called because of its use in bell-hanging to change
the direction of motion of the wires from horizontal to vertical
or vice versa, consists of two arms rigidly connected at an angle,
say of 90°, to each other and pivoted on a pin placed at the point
of junction.</p>

<p>Crank is also the name given to a labour machine used in
prisons as a means of punishment (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tread-mill</a></span>). Other uses
of the word, connected with the primary meaning, are for a
crooked path, a crevice or chink; and a freakish turn of thought
or speech, as in Milton&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;quips and cranks.&rdquo; It is also
used as a slang expression, American in origin, for a harmless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
lunatic, or a faddist, whose enthusiasm for some one idea or
hobby becomes a monomania. &ldquo;Crank&rdquo; or &ldquo;crank-sided&rdquo; is a
nautical term used of a ship which by reason of her build or from
want of balance is liable to overturn. This strictly nautical
sense is often confused with &ldquo;crank&rdquo; or &ldquo;cranky,&rdquo; that is,
rickety or shaky, probably derived direct from the German
<i>krank</i>, weak or ill.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRANMER, THOMAS<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1489-1556), archbishop of Canterbury,
born at Aslacton or Aslockton in Nottinghamshire on the 2nd of
July 1489, was the second son of Thomas Cranmer and of his
wife Anne Hatfield. He received his early education, according
to Morice his secretary, from &ldquo;a marvellous severe and cruel
schoolmaster,&rdquo; whose discipline must have been severe indeed to
deserve this special mention in an age when no schoolmaster
bore the rod in vain. The same authority tells us that he was
initiated by his father in those field sports, such as hunting and
hawking, which formed one of his recreations in after life. To
early training he also owed the skilful horsemanship for which
he was conspicuous. At the age of fourteen he was sent by his
mother, who had in 1501 become a widow, to Cambridge.
Little is known with certainty of his university career beyond the
facts that he became a fellow of Jesus College in 1510 or 1511,
that he had soon after to vacate his fellowship, owing to his
marriage to &ldquo;Black Joan,&rdquo; a relative of the landlady of the
Dolphin Inn, and that he was reinstated in it on the death of his
wife, which occurred in childbirth before the lapse of the year of
grace allowed by the statutes. During the brief period of his
married life he held the appointment of lecturer at Buckingham
Hall, now Magdalene College. The fact of his marrying would
seem to show that he did not at the time intend to enter the
church; possibly the death of his wife caused him to qualify
for holy orders. He was ordained in 1523, and soon after he took
his doctor&rsquo;s degree in divinity. According to Strype, he was
invited about this time to become a fellow of the college founded
by Cardinal Wolsey at Oxford; but Dean Hook shows that
there is some reason to doubt this. If the offer was made, it was
declined, and Cranmer continued at Cambridge filling the
offices of lecturer in divinity at his own college and of public
examiner in divinity to the university. It is interesting, in view
of his later efforts to spread the knowledge of the Bible among
the people, to know that in the capacity of examiner he insisted
on a thorough acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, and rejected
several candidates who were deficient in this qualification.</p>

<p>It was a somewhat curious concurrence of circumstances that
transferred Cranmer, almost at one step, from the quiet seclusion
of the university to the din and bustle of the court. In August
1529 the plague known as the sweating sickness, which prevailed
throughout the country, was specially severe at Cambridge, and
all who had it in their power forsook the town for the country.
Cranmer went with two of his pupils named Cressy, related to
him through their mother, to their father&rsquo;s house at Waltham in
Essex. The king (Henry VIII.) happened at the time to be
visiting in the immediate neighbourhood, and two of his chief
counsellors, Gardiner, secretary of state, afterwards bishop of
Winchester, and Edward Fox, the lord high almoner, afterwards
bishop of Hereford, were lodged at Cressy&rsquo;s house. Meeting
with Cranmer, they were naturally led to discuss the king&rsquo;s
meditated divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Cranmer suggested
that if the canonists and the universities should decide that
marriage with a deceased brother&rsquo;s widow was illegal, and if it
were proved that Catherine had been married to Prince Arthur,
her marriage to Henry could be declared null and void by the
ordinary ecclesiastical courts. The necessity of an appeal to
Rome was thus dispensed with, and this point was at once seen
by the king, who, when Cranmer&rsquo;s opinion was reported to him,
is said to have ordered him to be summoned in these terms:
&ldquo;I will speak to him. Let him be sent for out of hand. This
man, I trow, has got the right sow by the ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At their first interview Cranmer was commanded by the king
to lay aside all other pursuits and to devote himself to the
question of the divorce. He was to draw up a written treatise,
stating the course he proposed, and defending it by arguments
from scripture, the fathers and the decrees of general councils.
His material interests certainly did not suffer by compliance.
He was commended to the hospitality of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s father,
the earl of Wiltshire, in whose house at Durham Place he resided
for some time; the king appointed him archdeacon of Taunton
and one of his chaplains; and he also held a parochial benefice,
the name of which is unknown. When the treatise was finished
Cranmer was called upon to defend its argument before the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which he visited, accompanied
by Fox and Gardiner. Immediately afterwards he was
sent to plead the cause before a more powerful if not a higher
tribunal. An embassy, with the earl of Wiltshire at its head,
was despatched to Rome in 1530, that &ldquo;the matter of the divorce
should be disputed and ventilated,&rdquo; and Cranmer was an important
member of it. He was received by the Pope with
marked courtesy, and was appointed &ldquo;Grand Penitentiary of
England,&rdquo; but his argument, if he ever had the opportunity of
stating it, did not lead to any practical decision of the question.</p>

<p>Cranmer returned in September 1530, but in January 1531 he
received a second commission from the king appointing him
&ldquo;Conciliarius Regius et ad Caesarem Orator.&rdquo; In the summer
of 1531 he accordingly proceeded to Germany as sole ambassador
to the emperor. He was also to sound the Lutheran princes
with a view to an alliance, and to obtain the removal of some
restrictions on English trade. At Nuremberg he became acquainted
with Osiander, whose somewhat isolated theological
position he probably found to be in many points analogous to his
own. Both were convinced that the old order must change;
neither saw clearly what the new order should be to which it was
to give place. They had frequent interviews, which had doubtless
an important influence on Cranmer&rsquo;s opinions. But Osiander&rsquo;s
house had another attraction of a different kind from theological
sympathy. His niece Margaret won the heart of Cranmer, and in
1532 they were married. Hook finds in the fact of the marriage
corroboration of Cranmer&rsquo;s statement that he never expected or
desired the primacy; and it seems probable enough that, if he
had foreseen how soon the primacy was to be forced upon him,
he would have avoided a disqualification which it was difficult to
conceal and dangerous to disclose.</p>

<p>Expected or not, the primacy was forced upon him within a
very few months of his marriage. In August 1532 Archbishop
Warham died, and the king almost immediately afterwards
intimated to Cranmer, who had accompanied the emperor in his
campaign against the Turks, his nomination to the vacant see.
Cranmer&rsquo;s conduct was certainly consistent with his profession
that he did not desire, as he had not expected, the dangerous
promotion. He sent his wife to England, but delayed his own
return in the vain hope that another appointment might be made.
The papal bulls of confirmation were dated February and March
1533, and the consecration took place on the 30th March. One
peculiarity of the ceremony had occasioned considerable discussion.
It was the custom for the archbishop elect to take two
oaths, the first of episcopal allegiance to the pope, and the second
in recognition of the royal supremacy. The latter was so wide
in its scope that it might fairly be held to supersede the former in
so far as the two were inconsistent. Cranmer, however, was not
satisfied with this. He had a special protest recorded, in which
he formally declared that he swore allegiance to the pope only in
so far as that was consistent with his supreme duty to the king.
The morality of this course has been much canvassed, though it
seems really to involve nothing more than an express declaration
of what the two oaths implied. It was the course that would
readily suggest itself to a man of timid nature who wished to
secure himself against such a fate as Wolsey&rsquo;s. It showed
weakness, but it added nothing to whatever immorality there
might be in successively taking two incompatible oaths.</p>

<p>In the last as in the first step of Cranmer&rsquo;s promotion Henry
had been actuated by one and the same motive. The business of
the divorce&mdash;or rather, of the legitimation of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s
expected issue&mdash;had now become very urgent, and in the new
archbishop he had an agent who might be expected to forward it
with the needful haste. The celerity and skill with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
Cranmer did the work intrusted to him must have fully satisfied
his master. During the first week of April Convocation sat almost
from day to day to determine questions of fact and law in relation
to Catherine&rsquo;s marriage with Henry as affected by her previous
marriage with his brother Arthur. Decisions favourable to the
object of the king were given on these questions, though even
the despotism of the most despotic of the Tudors failed to secure
absolute unanimity. The next step was taken by Cranmer, who
wrote a letter to the king, praying to be allowed to remove the
anxiety of loyal subjects as to a possible case of disputed succession,
by finally determining the validity of the marriage in his
archiepiscopal court. There is evidence that the request was
prompted by the king, and his consent was given as a matter of
course. Queen Catherine was residing at Ampthill in Bedfordshire,
and to suit her convenience the court was held at the priory
of Dunstable in the immediate neighbourhood. Declining to
appear, she was declared contumacious, and on the 23rd of May
the archbishop gave judgment declaring the marriage null and
void from the first, and so leaving the king free to marry whom he
pleased. The Act of Appeals had already prohibited any appeal
from the archbishop&rsquo;s court. Five days later he pronounced
the marriage between Henry and Anne&mdash;which had been secretly
celebrated about the 25th of January 1533&mdash;to be valid. On the
1st of June he crowned Anne as queen, and on the 10th of September
stood godfather to her child, the future Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The breach with Rome and the subjection of the church in
England to the royal supremacy had been practically achieved
before Cranmer&rsquo;s appointment as archbishop: and he had little
to do with the other constitutional changes of Henry&rsquo;s reign.
But his position as chief minister of Henry&rsquo;s ecclesiastical
jurisdiction forced him into unpleasant prominence in connexion
with the king&rsquo;s matrimonial experiences. In 1536 he was
required to revise his own sentence in favour of the validity of
Henry&rsquo;s marriage with Anne Boleyn; and on the 17th of May
the marriage was declared invalid. The ground on which this
sentence is pronounced is fairly clear. Anne&rsquo;s sister, Mary
Boleyn, had been Henry VIII.&rsquo;s mistress; this by canon law was
a bar to his marriage with Anne&mdash;a bar which had been removed
by papal dispensation in 1527, but now the papal power to
dispense in such cases had been repudiated, and the original objection
revived. The sentence was grotesquely legal and unjust.
With Anne&rsquo;s condemnation by the House of Lords Cranmer
had nothing to do. He interceded for her in vain with the
king, as he had done in the cases of Fisher, More and the monks
of Christchurch. His share in the divorce of Anne of Cleves was
less prominent than that of Gardiner, though he did preside over
the Convocation in which nearly all the dignitaries of the church
signified their approval of that measure. To his next and last
interposition in the matrimonial affairs of the king no discredit
attaches itself. When he was made cognizant of the charges
against Catherine Howard, his duty to communicate them to the
king was obvious, though painful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cranmer was actively carrying out the policy
which has associated his name more closely, perhaps, than that
of any other ecclesiastic with the Reformation in England. Its
most important feature on the theological as distinct from the
political side was the endeavour to promote the circulation of the
Bible in the vernacular, by encouraging translation and procuring
an order in 1538 that a copy of the Bible in English should be
set up in every church in a convenient place for reading. Only
second in importance to this was the re-adjustment of the creed
and liturgy of the church, which formed Cranmer&rsquo;s principal work
during the latter half of his life. The progress of the archbishop&rsquo;s
opinion towards that middle Protestantism, if it may be so
called, which he did so much to impress on the formularies of the
Church of England, was gradual, as a brief enumeration of the
successive steps in that progress will show. In 1538 an embassy
of German divines visited England with the design, among other
things, of forming a common confession for the two countries.
This proved impracticable, but the frequent conferences Cranmer
had with the theologians composing the embassy had doubtless a
great influence in modifying his views. Both in parliament and
in Convocation he opposed the Six Articles of 1539, but he stood
almost alone. During the period between 1540 and 1543 the
archbishop was engaged at the head of a commission in the
revision of the &ldquo;Bishop&rsquo;s Book&rdquo; (1537) or <i>Institutions of a
Christian Man</i>, and the preparation of the <i>Necessary Erudition</i>
(1543) known as the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Book,&rdquo; which was a modification
of the former work in the direction of Roman Catholic doctrine.
In June 1545 was issued his Litany, which was substantially the
same as that now in use, and shows his mastery of a rhythmical
English style.</p>

<p>The course taken by Cranmer in promoting the Reformation
exposed him to the bitter hostility of the reactionary party or
&ldquo;men of the old learning,&rdquo; of whom Gardiner and Bonner were
leaders, and on various occasions&mdash;notably in 1543 and 1545&mdash;conspiracies
were formed in the council or elsewhere to effect his
overthrow. The king, however, remained true to him, and all the
conspiracies signally failed. It illustrates a favourable trait in
the archbishop&rsquo;s character that he forgave all the conspirators.
He was, as his secretary Morice testifies, &ldquo;a man that delighted
not in revenging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cranmer was present with Henry VIII. when he died (1547).
By the will of the king he was nominated one of a council of
regency composed of sixteen persons, but he acquiesced in the
arrangement by which Somerset became lord protector. He
officiated at the coronation of the boy king Edward VI., and is
supposed to have instituted a sinister change in the order of the
ceremony, by which the right of the monarch to reign was made to
appear to depend upon inheritance alone, without the concurrent
consent of the people. But Edward&rsquo;s title had been expressly
sanctioned by act of parliament, so that there was no more room
for election in his case than in that of George I., and the real
motive of the changes was to shorten the weary ceremony for the
frail child.</p>

<p>During this reign the work of the Reformation made rapid
progress, the sympathies both of the Protector and of the young
king being decidedly Protestant. Cranmer was therefore enabled
without let or hindrance to complete the preparation of the church
formularies, on which he had been for some time engaged. In
1547 appeared the <i>Homilies</i> prepared under his direction.
Four of them are attributed to the archbishop himself&mdash;those on
Salvation, Faith, Good Works and the Reading of Scripture.
His translation of the German Catechism of Justus Jonas, known
as Cranmer&rsquo;s Catechism, appeared in the following year. Important,
as showing his views on a cardinal doctrine, was the
<i>Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament</i>,
which he published in 1550. It was immediately answered from
the side of the &ldquo;old learning&rdquo; by Gardiner. The first prayer-book
of Edward VI. was finished in November 1548, and received
legal sanction in March 1549; the second was completed and
sanctioned in April 1552. The archbishop did much of the work
of compilation personally. The forty-two articles of Edward
VI. published in 1553 owe their form and style almost entirely
to the hand of Cranmer. The last great undertaking in which he
was employed was the revision of his codification of the canon
law, which had been all but completed before the death of Henry.
The task was one eminently well suited to his powers, and the
execution of it was marked by great skill in definition and arrangement.
It never received any authoritative sanction, Edward VI.
dying before the proclamation establishing it could be made, and
it remained unpublished until 1571, when a Latin translation by
Dr Walter Haddon and Sir John Cheke appeared under the title
<i>Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</i>. It laid down the lawfulness
and necessity of persecution to the death for heresy in the most
absolute terms; and Cranmer himself condemned Joan Bocher
to the flames. But he naturally loathed persecution, and was as
tolerant as any in that age.</p>

<p>Cranmer stood by the dying bed of Edward as he had stood by
that of his father, and he there suffered himself to be persuaded to
take a step against his own convictions. He had pledged himself
to respect the testamentary disposition of Henry VIII. by which
the succession devolved upon Mary, and now he violated his oath
by signing Edward&rsquo;s &ldquo;device&rdquo; of the crown to Lady Jane Grey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
On grounds of policy and morality alike the act was quite
indefensible; but it is perhaps some palliation of his perjury
that it was committed to satisfy the last urgent wish of a dying
man, and that he alone remained true to the nine days&rsquo; queen
when the others who had with him signed Edward&rsquo;s device
deserted her. On the accession of Mary he was summoned to the
council&mdash;most of whom had signed the same device&mdash;reprimanded
for his conduct, and ordered to confine himself to his palace at
Lambeth until the queen&rsquo;s pleasure was known. He refused to
follow the advice of his friends and avoid the fate that was
clearly impending over him by flight to the continent. Any
chance of safety that lay in the friendliness of a strong party in
the council was more than nullified by the bitter personal enmity
of the queen, who could not forgive his share in her mother&rsquo;s
divorce and her own disgrace. On the 14th of September 1553 he
was sent to the Tower, where Ridley and Latimer were also
confined. The immediate occasion of his imprisonment was a
strongly worded declaration he had written a few days previously
against the mass, the celebration of which, he heard, had been
re-established at Canterbury. He had not taken steps to
publish this, but by some unknown channel a copy reached the
council, and it could not be ignored. In November, with Lady
Jane Grey, her husband, and two other Dudleys, Cranmer was
condemned for treason. Renard thought he would be executed,
but so true a Romanist as Mary could scarcely have an ecclesiastic
put to death in consequence of a sentence by a secular court, and
Cranmer was reserved for treatment as a heretic by the highest of
clerical tribunals, which could not act until parliament had
restored the papal jurisdiction. Accordingly in March 1554 he
and his two illustrious fellow-prisoners, Ridley and Latimer, were
removed to Oxford, where they were confined in the Bocardo or
common prison. Ridley and Latimer were unflinching, and
suffered bravely at the stake on the 16th of October 1555.
Cranmer had been tried by a papal commission, over which
Bishop Brooks of Gloucester presided, in September 1555.
Brooks had no power to give sentence, but reported to Rome,
where Cranmer was summoned, but not permitted, to attend.
On the 25th of November he was pronounced contumacious by
the pope and excommunicated, and a commission was sent to
England to degrade him from his office of archbishop. This was
done with the usual humiliating ceremonies in Christ Church,
Oxford, on the 14th of February 1556, and he was then handed
over to the secular power. About the same time Cranmer
subscribed the first two of his &ldquo;recantations.&rdquo; His difficulty
consisted in the fact that, like all Anglicans of the 16th century, he
recognized no right of private judgment, but believed that the
state, as represented by monarchy, parliament and Convocation,
had an absolute right to determine the national faith and to
impose it on every Englishman. All these authorities had now
legally established Roman Catholicism as the national faith, and
Cranmer had no logical ground on which to resist. His early
&ldquo;recantations&rdquo; are merely recognitions of his lifelong conviction
of this right of the state. But his dilemma on this point led him
into further doubts, and he was eventually induced to revile his
whole career and the Reformation. This is what the government
wanted. Northumberland&rsquo;s recantation had done much
to discredit the Reformation, Cranmer&rsquo;s, it was hoped, would
complete the work. Hence the enormous effect of Cranmer&rsquo;s
recovery at the final scene. On the 21st of March he was taken
to St Mary&rsquo;s church, and asked to repeat his recantation in the
hearing of the people as he had promised. To the surprise of all
he declared with dignity and emphasis that what he had recently
done troubled him more than anything he ever did or said in his
whole life; that he renounced and refused all his recantations as
things written with his hand, contrary to the truth which he
thought in his heart; and that as his hand had offended, his
hand should be first burned when he came to the fire. As he had
said, his right hand was steadfastly exposed to the flames. The
calm cheerfulness and resolution with which he met his fate show
that he felt that he had cleared his conscience, and that his
recantation of his recantations was a repentance that needed not
to be repented of.</p>

<p>It was a noble end to what, in spite of its besetting sin of
infirmity of moral purpose, was a not ignoble life. The key to his
character is well given in what Hooper said of him in a letter to
Bullinger, that he was &ldquo;too fearful about what might happen to
him.&rdquo; This weakness was the worst blot on Cranmer&rsquo;s character,
but it was due in some measure to his painful capacity for seeing
both sides of a question at the same time, a temperament fatal to
martyrdom. As a theologian it is difficult to class him. As early
as 1538 he had repudiated the doctrine of Transubstantiation;
by 1550 he had rejected also the Real Presence (Pref. to his
<i>Answer to Dr Richard Smith</i>). But here he used the term &ldquo;real&rdquo;
somewhat unguardedly, for in his <i>Defence</i> he asserts a real presence,
but defines it as exclusively a spiritual presence; and he repudiates
the idea that the bread and wine were &ldquo;bare tokens.&rdquo;
His views on church polity were dominated by his implicit
belief in the divine right of kings (not of course the divine
<i>hereditary</i> right of kings) which the Anglicans felt it necessary to
set up against the divine right of popes. He set practically no
limits to the ecclesiastical authority of kings; they were as fully
the representatives of the church as the state, and Cranmer hardly
distinguished between the two. Church and state to him were
one.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRANNOG<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (Celt. <i>crann</i>, a tree), the term applied in Scotland
and Ireland to the stockaded islands so numerous in ancient
times in the lochs of both countries. The existence of these lake-dwellings
in Scotland was first made known by John Mackinlay, a
fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in a letter sent to
George Chalmers, the author of <i>Caledonia</i>, in 1813, describing two
crannogs, or fortified islands in Bute. The crannog of Lagore, the
first discovered in Ireland, was examined and described by Sir
William Wilde in 1840. But it was not until after the discovery
of the pile-villages of the Swiss lakes, in 1853, had drawn public
attention to the subject of lake-dwellings, that the crannogs of
Scotland and Ireland were systematically investigated.</p>

<p>The results of these investigations show that they have little
in common with the Swiss lake-dwellings, except that they are
placed in lakes. Few examples are known in England, although
over a hundred and fifty have been examined in Ireland, and more
than half that number in Scotland. As a rule they have been
constructed on islets or shallows in the lochs, which have been
adapted for occupation, and fortified by single or double lines of
stockaded defences drawn round the margin. To enlarge the
area, or raise the surface-level where that was necessary,
layers of logs, brushwood, heather and ferns were piled on
the shallow, and consolidated with gravel and stones. Over all
there was laid a layer of earth, a floor of logs or a pavement of
flagstones. In rare instances the body of the work is entirely of
stones, the stockaded defence and the huts within its enclosure
being the only parts constructed of timber. Occasionally a
bridge of logs, or a causeway of stones, formed a communication
with the shore, but often the only means of getting to and from
the island was by canoes hollowed out of a single tree. Remains
of huts of logs, or of wattled work, are often found within the
enclosure. Three crannogs in Dowalton Loch, Wigtownshire,
examined by Lord Lovaine in 1863, were found to be constructed
of layers of fern and birch and hazel branches, mixed with
boulders and penetrated by oak piles, while above all there was a
surface layer of stones and soil. The remains of the stockade
round the margin were of vertical piles mortised into horizontal
bars, and secured by pegs in the mortised holes. The crannog of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
Lochlee, near Tarbolton, Ayrshire, explored by Dr R. Munro in
1878, was 100 ft. in diameter, and had a double row of piles, bound
by horizontal stretchers with square mortise-holes, enclosing an
area 60 ft. in diameter. In the centre was a space 40 ft. square,
bounded by the remains of a wooden wall and paved inside with
split logs. A partition divided it into two equal parts, one of
which had a doorway opening to the south, and close by it an
extensive refuse-heap. In the middle of the other part was a
stone-paved hearth, with remains of three former hearths
underneath. The substructure was built up from the bottom of
the loch, partly of brushwood but chiefly of logs and trunks of
trees with the branches lopped off, placed in layers, each disposed
transversely or obliquely across the one below it. A crannog in
Loch-an-Dhugael, Balinakill, Argyllshire, described by the same
explorer in 1893, revealed a substructure similar to that at
Lochlee, with a double row of piles enclosing an area 45 to 50 ft.
in diameter, within which was a circular construction 32 ft. in
diameter, which had been supported by a large central post and
about twenty uprights ranged round the circumference.</p>

<p>From their common feature of a substructure of brushwood and
logs built up from the bottom, the crannogs have been classed as
fascine-dwellings, to distinguish them from the typical pile-dwellings
of the earlier periods in Switzerland, whose platforms
are supported by piles driven into the bed of the lake. The
crannog of Cloonfinlough in Connaught had a triple stockade of
oak piles, connected by horizontal stretchers and enclosing an
area 130 ft. in diameter, laid with trunks of oak trees. In the
crannog of Lagore, county Meath, there were about 150 cartloads
of bones, chiefly of oxen, deer, sheep and swine, the refuse of the
food of the occupants. In the crannog of Lisnacroghera, county
Antrim, iron swords, with sheaths of thin bronze ornamented with
scrolls characteristic of the Late Celtic style, iron daggers, an iron
spear-head 16½ in. in length, and pieces of what are called large
caldrons of iron, were found. Among the few remains of
lacustrine settlements in England and Wales, some are suggestive
of the typical crannog structure. The most important of these is
the Glastonbury lake village, excavated by Mr A. Bulleid and
Mr St George Gray. It consists of more than sixty separate
dwellings, grouped within a triangular palisaded defence, formed
in the midst of a marsh now partially reclaimed. The dwellings
were circular, from 18 to 35 ft. in diameter, the substructure
formed of logs and brushwood mingled with stones and clay, and
outlined by piles driven into the bottom of the shallow lake.
The walls of the houses seem to have been made of wattle-work,
supported by posts sometimes not more than a single foot apart.
The floors are of clay, with a hearth of stones in the centre, often
showing several renewals over the original. The relics recovered
show unmistakably that the occupation must be dated within
the Iron Age, but probably pre-Roman, as no evidence of contact
with Roman civilization has been discovered. The stage of
civilization indicated is nevertheless not a low one. Besides the
implements and weapons of iron there are fibulae and brooches of
bronze, weaving combs and spindle-whorls, a bronze mirror and
tweezers, wheel-made pottery as well as hand-made, ornamented
with Late Celtic patterns, a bowl of thin bronze decorated with
bosses, the nave of a wooden wheel with holes for twelve spokes,
and a dug-out canoe. Another site in Holderness, Yorkshire,
examined by Mr Boynton in 1881, yielded evidence of fascine
construction, with suggestions of occupation in the latter part of
the Bronze Age. Similar indications are adduced by Professor
Boyd Dawkins from the site on Barton Mere. On the other
hand, the implements and weapons found in the Scottish and
Irish crannogs are usually of iron, or, if objects of bronze and
stone are found, they are commonly such as were in use in the
Iron Age. Crannogs are frequently referred to in the Irish
annals. Under the year 848 the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>
record the burning of the island of Lough Gabhor (the crannog
of Lagore), and the same stronghold is noticed as again destroyed
by the Danes in 933. Under the year 1246 it is recorded that
Turlough O&rsquo;Connor made his escape from the crannog of Lough
Leisi, and drowned his keepers. Many other entries occur in the
succeeding centuries. In the register of the privy council of
Scotland, April 14, 1608, it is ordered that &ldquo;the haill houssis of
defence, strongholds, and <i>crannokis</i> in the Yllis (the western
isles) pertaining to Angus M&rsquo;Conneill of Dunnyvaig and Hector
M&rsquo;Cloyne of Dowart sal be delyverit to His Majestie.&rdquo; Judging
from the historical evidence of their late continuance, and from
the character of the relics found in them, the crannogs may be
included among the latest prehistoric strongholds, reaching their
greatest development in early historic times, and surviving
through the middle ages. In Ireland, Sir William Wilde has
assigned their range approximately to the period between the
9th and 16th centuries; while Dr Munro holds that the vast
majority of them, both in Ireland and in Scotland, were not only
inhabited, but constructed during the Iron Age, and that their
period of greatest development was as far posterior to Roman
civilization as that of the Swiss <i>Pfahlbauten</i> was anterior to it.

8099; (1900) 13,343; (1910) 21,107; area, 30 sq. m. It is
served by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railway.
The surface of the E. part is level, that of the W. part is somewhat
rolling. Within the city are several villages, including
Arlington, Auburn, Edgewood, Fiskeville and Oaklawn. The
inhabitants of the country districts are engaged largely in the
growing of hay, Indian corn, rye, oats and market-garden
produce; in the several villages cotton and print goods, fuses for
electrical machinery, and automatic fire-protection sprinklers are
manufactured. The value of Cranston&rsquo;s factory product
increased from $1,402,359 in 1900 to $2,130,969 in 1905, or 52%.
The state has a farm of 667 acres in the S. part of the city;
on this are the state prison, the Providence county jail, the
state workhouse and the house of correction, the state almshouse,
the state hospital for the insane, the Sockanosset school for
boys, and the Oaklawn school for girls&mdash;the last two being
departments of the state reform school. The post-office address
of all these state institutions is Howard. Cranston was settled
as a part of Providence about 1640 by associates of Roger Williams,
and in 1754 was incorporated as a separate township, but in 1868,
in 1873 and in 1892 portions of it were reannexed to Providence.
The township is said to have been named in honour of Samuel
Cranston (1659-1727), governor of Rhode Island from 1698 until
his death. It was incorporated as a city in 1910.</p>

Rolfe, was born at Cranworth, Norfolk, on the 18th of December
1790. Educated at Bury St Edmunds, Winchester, and Trinity
College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in
1816, and attached himself to the chancery courts. He represented
Penryn and Falmouth in parliament from 1832 till his
promotion to the bench as baron of the exchequer in 1839. In
1850 he was appointed a vice-chancellor and created Baron
Cranworth, and in 1852 he became lord chancellor in Aberdeen&rsquo;s
ministry. He continued to hold the chancellorship in the
administration of Palmerston until the latter&rsquo;s resignation in
1857. He was not reappointed when Palmerston returned to
office in 1859, but on the retirement of Lord Westbury in 1865 he
accepted the great seal for a second time, and held it till the fall
of the Russell administration in 1866. Cranworth died in London
on the 26th of July 1868. Never a very zealous law reformer,
Cranworth&rsquo;s name is associated in the statute book with only one
small measure on conveyancing. But as a judge he will continue
to hold first rank. His judgments were marked by sound common

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAPE<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (an anglicized version of the Fr. <i>crêpe</i>), a silk fabric of
a gauzy texture, having a peculiar crisp or crimpy appearance.
It is woven of hard spun silk yarn &ldquo;in the gum&rdquo; or natural
condition. There are two distinct varieties of the textile&mdash;soft,
Canton or Oriental crape, and hard or crisped crape. The wavy
appearance of Canton crape results from the peculiar manner in
which the weft is prepared, the yarn from two bobbins being
twisted together in the reverse way. The fabric when woven is
smooth and even, having no <i>crêpé</i> appearance, but when the gum
is subsequently extracted by boiling it at once becomes soft, and
the weft, losing its twist, gives the fabric the waved structure
which constitutes its distinguishing feature. Canton crapes are
used, either white or coloured, for ladies&rsquo; scarves and shawls,
bonnet trimmings, &amp;c. The Chinese and Japanese excel in the
manufacture of soft crapes. The crisp and elastic structure of
hard crape is not produced either in the spinning or in the weaving,
but is due to processes through which the gauze passes after it is
woven. What the details of these processes are is known to only
a few manufacturers, who so jealously guard their secret that, in
some cases, the different stages in the manufacture are conducted
in towns far removed from each other. Commercially they are
distinguished as single, double, three-ply and four-ply crapes,
according to the nature of the yarn used in their manufacture.
They are almost exclusively dyed black and used in mourning
dress, and among Roman Catholic communities for nuns&rsquo; veils,
&amp;c. In Great Britain hard crapes are made at Braintree in Essex,
Norwich, Yarmouth, Manchester and Glasgow. The crape
formerly made at Norwich was made with a silk warp and
worsted weft, and is said to have afterwards degenerated into
bombazine. A very successful imitation of real crape is made in
Manchester of cotton yarn, and sold under the name of Victoria
crape.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRASH,<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> a technical textile term applied to a species of narrow
towels, from 14 to 20 in. wide. The name is probably of Russian
origin, the simplest and coarsest type of the cloth being known as
&ldquo;Russia crash.&rdquo; The latter is made from grey flax or tow yarns,
and sometimes from boiled yarns. The simple term &ldquo;crash&rdquo; is
given to all these narrow cloths, but the above distinction is
very convenient, as also are the following: grey, boiled, bleached,
plain, twilled and fancy crash. A large variety obtains with and
without fancy borders, while of late years cotton has been
introduced as warp, as well as mixed and jute yarns for weft.
After the cloth has passed through all the finishing operations,
it is cut up into lengths of about 3 yds., the two ends sewn
together and it is then ready to be placed over a suspended roller;
for this reason it is often termed &ldquo;roller towelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRASHAW, RICHARD<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1613-1650), English poet, styled
&ldquo;the divine,&rdquo; was born in London about 1613. He was the son
of a strongly anti-papistical divine, Dr William Crashaw (1572-1626),
who distinguished himself, even in those times, by the
excessive acerbity of his writings against the Catholics. In spite
of these opinions, however, he was attracted by Catholic devotion,
for he translated several Latin hymns of the Jesuits. Richard
Crashaw was originally put to school at Charterhouse, but in
July 1631 he was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge,
where he took the degree of B.A. in 1634. The publication of
Herbert&rsquo;s <i>Temple</i> in 1633 seems to have finally determined the
bias of his genius in favour of religious poetry, and next year he
published his first book, <i>Epigrammatum sacrorum liber</i>, a
volume of Latin verses. In March 1636 he removed to Peterhouse,
was made a fellow of that college in 1637, and proceeded
M.A. in 1638. It was about this time that he made the acquaintance
and secured the lasting friendship of Abraham Cowley.
He was also on terms of intimacy with the Anglican monk
Nicholas Ferrar, and frequently visited him at his religious
house at Little Gidding. In 1641 he is said to have gone to
Oxford, but only for a short time; for when in 1643 Cowley left
Cambridge to seek a refuge at Oxford, Crashaw remained behind,
and was forcibly ejected from his fellowship in 1644. In the
confusion of the civil wars he escaped to France, where he
finally embraced the Catholic religion, towards which he had
long been tending.</p>

<p>During his exile his religious and secular poems were collected
by an anonymous friend, and published under the title of <i>Steps to
the Temple</i> and <i>The Delights of the Muses</i>, in one volume, in 1646.
The first part includes the hymn to St Teresa and the version of
Marini&rsquo;s <i>Sospetto d&rsquo; Herode</i>. This same year Cowley found him in
great destitution at Paris, and induced Queen Henrietta Maria to
extend towards him what influence she still possessed. At her
introduction he proceeded to Italy, where he became attendant
to Cardinal Palotta at Rome. In 1648 he published two Latin
hymns at Paris. He remained until 1649 in the service of the
cardinal, to whom he had a great personal attachment; but his
retinue contained persons whose violent and licentious behaviour
was a source of ceaseless vexation to the sensitive English
mystic. At last his denunciation of their excesses became so
public that the animosity of those persons was excited against
him, and in order to shield him from their revenge he was sent by
the cardinal in 1650 to Loretto, where he was made a canon of the
Holy House. In less than three weeks, however, he sickened of
fever, and died on the 25th of August, not without grave suspicion
of having been poisoned. He was buried in the Lady chapel at
Loretto. A collection of his religious poems, entitled <i>Carmen
Deo nostro</i>, was brought out in Paris in 1652, dedicated at
the dead poet&rsquo;s desire to the faithful friend of his sufferings,
the countess of Denbigh. The book is illustrated by thirteen
engravings after Crashaw&rsquo;s own designs.</p>

<p>Crashaw excelled in all manner of graceful accomplishments;
besides being an excellent Latinist and Hellenist, he had an
intimate knowledge of Italian and Spanish; and his skill in music,
painting and engraving was no less admired in his lifetime than
his skill in poetry. Cowley embalmed his memory in an elegy
that ranks among the very finest in our language, in which he,
a Protestant, well expressed the feeling left on the minds of
contemporaries by the character of the young Catholic poet:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;His faith, perhaps, in some nice tenets might</p>

<p class="i05">And I, myself, a Catholic will be,</p>
<p class="i05">So far at least, dear saint, to pray to thee!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The poetry of Crashaw will be best appreciated by those who can
with most success free themselves from the bondage of a traditional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
sense of the dignity of language. The custom of his age permitted
the use of images and phrases which we now justly condemn as
incongruous and unseemly, and the fervent fancy of Crashaw
carried this licence to excess. At the same time his verse is
studded with fiery beauties and sudden felicities of language,
unsurpassed by any lyrist between his own time and Shelley&rsquo;s.
There is no religious poetry in English so full at once of gross and
awkward images and imaginative touches of the most ethereal
beauty. The temper of his intellect seems to have been delicate
and weak, fiery and uncertain; he has a morbid, almost
hysterical, passion about him, even when his ardour is most
exquisitely expressed, and his adoring addresses to the saints have
an effeminate falsetto that makes their ecstasy almost repulsive.
The faults and beauties of his very peculiar style can be studied
nowhere to more advantage than in the <i>Hymn to Saint Teresa</i>.
Among the secular poems of Crashaw the best are <i>Music&rsquo;s Duel</i>,
which deals with that strife between the musician and the nightingale
which has inspired so many poets, and <i>Wishes to his
supposed Mistress</i>. In his latest sacred poems, included in the
<i>Carmen Deo nostro</i>, sudden and eminent beauties are not wanting,
but the mysticism has become more pronounced, and the ecclesiastical
mannerism more harsh and repellent. The themes of
Crashaw&rsquo;s verses are as distinct as possible from those of Shelley&rsquo;s,
but it may, on the whole, be said that at his best moments he
reminds the reader more closely of the author of <i>Epipsychidion</i>
than of any earlier or later poet.</p>

<p>Crashaw&rsquo;s works were first collected, in one volume, in 1858 by
W. B. Turnbull. In 1872 an edition, in 2 volumes, was printed for
private subscription by the Rev. A. B. Grosart. A complete edition
was edited (1904) for the Cambridge University Press by Mr A. R.

by a thickly cuticularized epidermis covered with a waxy
secretion which gives a glaucous appearance to the plant. The
flowers are generally arranged in terminal or axillary clusters, and
are markedly regular with the same number of parts in each
series. This number is, however, very variable, and often not
constant in one and the same species. The sepals and petals are
free or more or less united, the stamens as many or twice as many
as the petals; the carpels, usually free, are equal to the petals in
number, and form in the fruit follicles with two or more seeds.
Opposite each carpel is a small scale which functions as a nectary.
Means of vegetative propagation are general. Many species
spread by means of a creeping much-branched rootstock, or as in
house-leek, by runners which perish after producing a terminal
leaf-rosette. In other cases small portions of the stem or leaves
give rise to new plants by budding, as in <i>Bryophyllum</i>, where
buds develop at the edges of the leaf and form new plants.</p>

<p>The order is almost absent from Australia and Polynesia, and
has but few representatives in South America; it is otherwise very
generally distributed. The largest genus, <i>Sedum</i>, contains about
140 species in the temperate and colder parts of the northern
hemisphere; eight occur wild in Britain, including <i>S. Telephium</i>
(orpine) and <i>S. acre</i> (common stonecrop) (see fig.). The species
are easily cultivated and will thrive in almost any soil. They
are readily propagated by seeds, cuttings or divisions. <i>Crassula</i>
has about 100 species, chiefly at the Cape. <i>Cotyledon</i>, a widely
distributed genus with about 90 species, is represented in the
British Isles by <i>C. Umbilicus</i>, pennywort, or navelwort, which
takes its name from the succulent peltate leaves. It grows
profusely on dry rocks and walls, especially on the western
coasts, and bears a spike of drooping greenish cup-shaped flowers.
The <i>Echeveria</i> of gardens is now included in this genus. <i>Sempervivum</i>
has about 50 species in the mountains of central and
southern Europe, in the Himalayas, Abyssinia, and the Canaries
and Madeira; <i>S. tectorum</i>, common house-leek, is seen often
growing on tops of walls and house-roofs. The hardy species will
grow well in dry sandy soil, and are suitable for rockeries, old walls
or edgings. They are readily propagated by offsets or by seed.</p>

<p>The order is closely allied to Saxifragaceae, from which it is
distinguished by its fleshy habit and the larger number of carpels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRASSUS<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (literally &ldquo;dense,&rdquo; &ldquo;thick,&rdquo; &ldquo;fat&rdquo;), a family name
in the Roman gens Licinia (plebeian). The most important of
the name are the following:</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Publius Licinius Crassus</span>, surnamed <i>Dives Mucianus</i>,
Roman statesman, orator and jurist, consul, 131 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He was
the son of P. Mucius Scaevola (consul 175) and was adopted by
a P. Licinius Crassus Dives. An intimate friend of Tiberius
Gracchus, he was chosen after his death to take his place on the
agrarian commission (see <span class="sc">Gracchus</span>). In 131 when Crassus was
consul with L. Valerius Flaccus, Aristonicus, an illegitimate son
of Eumenes II. of Pergamum, laid claim to the kingdom, which
had been bequeathed by Attalus III. to Rome. Both consuls
were anxious to obtain the command against him; Crassus
was pontifex maximus, and Flaccus a flamen of Mars. Crassus
declared that Flaccus could not neglect his sacred office, and imposed
a conditional fine on him in the event of his leaving Rome.
The popular assembly remitted the fine, but Flaccus was ordered
to obey the pontifex maximus. Crassus accordingly proceeded
to Asia, although in doing so he violated the rule which forbade
the pontifex maximus to leave Italy. Nothing is known of his
military operations. But in the following year, when he was
making preparations to return, he was surprised near Leucae.
He was himself taken prisoner by a Thracian band, and provoked
his captors, who were ignorant of his identity, to put him to
death. Crassus does not seem to have possessed much military
ability, but he was greatly distinguished for his knowledge of law
and his accomplished oratory. He had acquired such a mastery
of the Greek language that, when he presided over the courts in
Asia, he was able to answer each suitor in ordinary Greek or any
of the dialects in use.</p>

</div>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Lucius Licinius Crassus</span> (140-91 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the orator, of
unknown parentage. At the age of nineteen (or twenty-one) he
made his reputation by a speech against C. Papirius Carbo, the
friend of the Gracchi. The law passed by him and his colleague
Q. Mucius Scaevola during their consulship (95), to prevent those
passing as Roman citizens who had no right to the title, was one of
the prime causes of the Social War (Cicero, <i>Pro Balbo</i>, xxi., <i>De
officiis</i>, iii. 11). During his censorship Crassus suppressed the
newly founded schools of Latin rhetoricians (Aulus Gellius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
xv. 11). He died from excitement caused by his passionate
speech against the consul L. Marcius Philippus, who had insulted
the Senate. Crassus is one of the chief speakers in the <i>De oratore</i>
of Cicero, who has also preserved a few fragments of his speeches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Publius Licinius Crassus</span>, called <i>Dives</i>, father of the
triumvir. Little is known of him before he became consul in 97,
except that he proposed a law regulating the expenses of the table,
which met with general approval. During his consulship the
practice of magic arts was condemned by a decree of the senate,
and human sacrifice was abolished. He was subsequently
governor of Spain for some years, during which he gained several
successes over the Lusitanians, and on his return in 93 was
honoured with a triumph. After the Social War, as censor with
L. Julius Caesar, he had the task of enrolling in new tribes certain
of the Latins and Italians as a reward for their loyalty to the
Romans, but the proceedings seem to have been interrupted
by certain irregularities. They also forbade the introduction of
foreign wines and unguents. Crassus committed suicide in 87, to
avoid falling into the hands of the Marian party.</p>

</div>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Marcus Licinius Crassus</span> (c. 115-53 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the Triumvir,
surnamed <i>Dives</i> (rich) on account of his great wealth. His
wealth was acquired by traffic in slaves, the working of silver
mines, and judicious purchases of lands and houses, especially
those of proscribed citizens. The proscription of Cinna obliged
him to flee to Spain; but after Cinna&rsquo;s death he passed into
Africa, and thence to Italy, where he ingratiated himself with
Sulla. Having been sent against Spartacus, he gained a decisive
victory, and was honoured with a minor triumph. Soon afterwards
he was elected consul with Pompey, and (70) displayed his
wealth by entertaining the populace at 10,000 tables, and
distributing sufficient corn to last each family three months. In
65 he was censor, and in 60 he joined Pompey and Caesar in the
coalition known as the first triumvirate. In 55 he was again
consul with Pompey, and a law was passed, assigning the provinces
of the two Spains and Syria to the two consuls for five years.
Crassus was satisfied with Syria, which promised to be an
inexhaustible source of wealth. Having crossed the Euphrates
he hastened to make himself master of Parthia; but he was
defeated at Carrhae (53 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and taken prisoner by Surenas, the
Parthian general, who put him to death by pouring molten gold
down his throat. His head was cut off and sent to Orodes, the
Parthian king. Crassus was a man of only moderate abilities,
and owed his importance to his great wealth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATER,<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> the cavity at the mouth of a volcanic duct, usually
funnel-shaped or presenting the form of a bowl, whence the name,
from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="kratêr">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#942;&#961;</span>, a bowl. A volcanic hill may have a single
crater at, or near, its summit, or it may have several minor craters
on its flanks: the latter are sometimes called &ldquo;adventitious
craters&rdquo; or &ldquo;craterlets.&rdquo; Much of the loose ejected material,
falling in the neighbourhood of the vent, rolls down the inner
wall of the crater, and thus produces a stratification with an
inward dip. The crater in an active volcano is kept open by
intermittent explosions, but in a volcano which has become
dormant or extinct the vent may become plugged, and the bowl-shaped
cavity may subsequently be filled with water, forming a
crater-lake, or as it is called in the Eifel a <i>Maar</i>. In some
basaltic cones, like those of the Sandwich Islands, the crater may
be a broad shallow pit, having almost perpendicular walls, with
horizontal stratification. Such hollows are consequently called
pit-craters. The name <i>caldera</i> (Sp. for cauldron) was suggested
for such pits by Capt. C. E. Dutton, who regarded them as
having been formed by subsidence of the walls. The term
caldera is often applied to bowl-shaped craters in Spanish-speaking
countries. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volcano</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATES<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span>, Athenian actor and author of comedies, flourished
about 470 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He was regarded as the founder of Greek comedy
proper, since he abandoned political lampoons on individuals,
and introduced more general subjects and a well-developed plot
(Aristotle, <i>Poëtica</i>, 5). He is stated to have been the first to
represent the drunkard on the stage (Aristophanes, <i>Knights</i>,
37 ff.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATES,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> the name of two Greek philosophers.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Crates</span>, of Athens, successor of Polemo as leader of the
Old Academy.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Crates</span>, of Thebes, a Cynic philosopher of the latter half of
the 4th century. He was the famous pupil of Diogenes, and the
last great representative of Cynicism. It is said that he lost his
ample fortune owing to the Macedonian invasion, but a more
probable story is that he sacrificed it in accordance with his
principles, directing the banker, to whom he entrusted it, to give
it to his sons if they should prove fools, but to the poor if his sons
should prove philosophers. He gave up his life to the attainment
of virtue and the propagation of ascetic self-control. His habit of
entering houses for this purpose, uninvited, earned him the
nickname <span class="grk" title="Thyrepanoiktês">&#920;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;Door-opener&rdquo;). His marriage with
Hipparchia, daughter of a wealthy Thracian family, was in
curious contrast to the prosaic character of his life. Attracted by
the nobility of his character and undeterred by his poverty and
ugliness, she insisted on becoming his wife in defiance of her
father&rsquo;s commands. The date of his death is unknown, though he
seems to have lived into the 3rd century. His writings were few.
According to Diogenes Laërtius, he was the author of a number
of letters on philosophical subjects; but those extant under the
name of Crates (R. Hercher, <i>Epistolographi Graeci</i>, 1873) are,
spurious, the work of later rhetoricians. Diogenes Laërtius
credits him with a short poem, <span class="grk" title="Paignia">&#928;&#945;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#953;&#945;</span>, and several philosophic
tragedies. Plutarch&rsquo;s life of Crates is lost. The great importance
of Crates&rsquo; work is that he formed the link between Cynicism and
the Stoics, Zeno of Citium being his pupil.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATES,<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> of Mallus in Cilicia, a Greek grammarian and Stoic
philosopher of the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, leader of the literary school
and head of the library of Pergamum. His principles were
opposed to those of Aristarchus, the leader of the Alexandrian
school. He was the chief representative of the allegorical theory
of exegesis, and maintained that Homer intended to express
scientific or philosophical truths in the form of poetry. About
170 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he visited Rome as ambassador of Attalus II., king of
Pergamum; and having broken his leg and been compelled to
stay there for some time, he delivered lectures which gave the
first impulse to the study of grammar and criticism among the
Romans (Suetonius, <i>De grammaticis</i>, 2). His chief work was a
critical and exegetical commentary on Homer.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRATINUS<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (c. 520-423 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Athenian comic poet, chief
representative of the old, and founder of political, comedy.
Hardly anything is known of his life, and only fragments of his
works have been preserved. But a good idea of their character
can be gained from the opinions of his contemporaries, especially
Aristophanes. His comedies were chiefly distinguished by their
direct and vigorous political satire, a marked exception being the
burlesque <span class="grk" title="Odysseis">&#8008;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span>, dealing with the story of Odysseus in the
cave of Polyphemus, probably written while a law was in force
forbidding all political references on the stage. They were also
remarkable for the absence of the parabasis and chorus. Persius
calls the author &ldquo;the bold,&rdquo; and even Pericles at the height of his
power did not escape his vehement attacks, as in the <i>Nemesis</i> and
<i>Archilochi</i>, the last-named a lament for the loss of the recently
deceased Cimon, with whose conservative sentiments Cratinus
was in sympathy. The <i>Panoptae</i> was a satire on the sophists
and omniscient speculative philosophers of the day. Of his last
comedy the plot has come down to us. It was occasioned by the
sneers of Aristophanes and others, who declared that he was no
better than a doting drunkard. Roused by the taunt, Cratinus
put forth all his strength, and in 423 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> produced the <span class="grk" title="Pytinê">&#928;&#965;&#964;&#943;&#957;&#951;</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
or <i>Bottle</i>, which gained the first prize over the <i>Clouds</i> of Aristophanes.
In this comedy, good-humouredly making fun of his
own weakness, Cratinus represents the comic muse as the
faithful wife of his youth. His guilty fondness for a rival&mdash;the
bottle&mdash;has aroused her jealousy. She demands a divorce from
the archon; but her husband&rsquo;s love is not dead and he returns
penitent to her side. In Grenfell and Hunt&rsquo;s <i>Oxyrhynchus
Papyri</i>, iv. (1904), containing a further instalment of their
edition of the Behnesa papyri discovered by them in 1896-1897,
one of the greatest curiosities is a scrap of paper bearing the
argument of a play by Cratinus,&mdash;the <i>Dionysalexandros</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
Dionysus in the part of Paris), aimed against Pericles; and the
epitome reveals something of its wit and point. The style of
Cratinus has been likened to that of Aeschylus; and Aristophanes,
in the <i>Knights</i>, compares him to a rushing torrent. He appears to
have been fond of lofty diction and bold figures, and was most
successful in the lyrical parts of his dramas, his choruses being the
popular festal songs of his day. According to the statement of a
doubtful authority, which is not borne out by Aristotle, Cratinus
increased the number of actors in comedy to three. He wrote
21 comedies and gained the prize nine times.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Fragments in Meineke, <i>Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum</i>, or
Kock, <i>Comicorum Atticorum fragmenta</i>. A younger Cratinus
flourished in the time of Alexander the Great. It is considered that
some of the comedies ascribed to the elder Cratinus were really the
work of the younger.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATIPPUS<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (fl. c. 375 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Greek historian. There are only
three or four references to him in ancient literature, and his
importance is due to the fact that he has been identified by several
scholars (<i>e.g.</i> Blass) with the author of the historical fragment
discovered by Grenfell and Hunt, and published by them in
<i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i>, vol. v. It may be regarded as a fairly
certain inference from a passage in Plutarch (<i>De Gloria Atheniensium</i>,
p. 345 E, ed. Bernardakis, ii. p. 455) that he was an
Athenian writer, intermediate in date between Thucydides and
Xenophon, and that his work continued the narrative of Thucydides,
from the point at which the latter historian stopped (410
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) down to the battle of Cnidus (394 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRATIPPUS,<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> of Mitylene (1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Peripatetic
philosopher, contemporary with Cicero, whose son he taught at
Athens, and by whom he is praised in the <i>De officiis</i> as the
greatest of his school. He was the friend of Pompey also and
shared his flight after the battle of Pharsalia, for the purpose, it
is said, of convincing him of the justice of providence. Brutus,
while at Athens after the assassination of Caesar, attended his
lectures. The freedom of Rome was conferred upon him by
Caesar, at the request of Cicero. The only work attributed to
him is a treatise on divination, but his reputation may be
gauged by the fact that in 44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the Areopagus invited him to
succeed Andronicus of Rhodes as scholarch. He seems to have
held that, while motion, sense and appetite cannot exist apart
from the body, thought reaches its greatest power when most free
from bodily influence, and that divination is due to the direct
action of the divine mind on that faculty of the human soul
which is not dependent on the body.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAU<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (from a Celtic root meaning &ldquo;stone&rdquo;), a region of
southern France, comprised in the department of Bouches-du-Rhone,
and bounded W. by the canal from Arles to Port du
Bouc and the Rhone, N. by the chain of the Alpines separating it
from an analogous region, the Petite Crau, E. by the hills around
Salon and Istres, S. by the gulf of Fos, an inlet of the Mediterranean
Sea. Covering an area of about 200 sq. m., the Crau is a
low-lying, waterless plain, owing its formation to a sudden
inundation, according to some authorities, of the Rhone and the
Durance, according to others of the Durance alone. Its surface
is formed chiefly of stones varying in size from an egg to a man&rsquo;s
head; these, mixed with a proportion of fine soil, overlie a
subsoil formed of stones cemented into a hard mass by deposits of
calcareous mud, beneath which lies a bed of loose stones, once the
sea-bed. Naturally sterile and poor in lime, the Crau is adapted
for agriculture by the process of warping, carried out by means of
the Canal de Craponne, which dates from the middle of the 16th
century; about one-quarter of the region in the north and east
has thus been covered by the rich deposits of the waters of the
Durance. The soil also responds in places to deep cultivation
and the application of artificial manures. By these aids, uncultivated
land, which before supplied only rough and scanty
pasture for a few sheep, has been fitted for the growth of the vine,
olive and other fruits; where irrigation is practicable, water-meadows
have been formed. The dryness of the climate is
unfavourable to the production of cereals.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAUCK, GUSTAVE<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (1827-1905), French sculptor, was born
and died at Valenciennes, where a special museum for his works
was erected in his honour. Though little known to the world
at large during his long life, he ranks among the best modern
sculptors of France. At Paris his &ldquo;Coligny&rdquo; monument is in the
rue de Rivoli; his &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; in the Place des Arts et Métiers;
and &ldquo;Twilight&rdquo; in the Avenue de l&rsquo;Observatoire. Among his
finest works is his &ldquo;Combat du Centaure,&rdquo; on which he was
engaged for thirty years, the figure of the Lapith having been
modelled after the athlete, Eugene Sandow. In 1907 an exhibition
of his works was held in the École des Beaux-Arts.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRAUFURD, QUINTIN<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (1743-1819), British author, was born
at Kilwinnock on the 22nd of September 1743. In early life he
went to India, where he entered the service of the East India
Company. Returning to Europe before the age of forty with a
handsome fortune, he settled in Paris, where he gave himself to
the cultivation of literature and art, and formed a good library
and collection of paintings, coins and other objects of antiquarian
interest. Craufurd was on intimate terms with the French court,
especially with Marie Antoinette, and was one of those who
arranged the flight to Varennes. He escaped to Brussels, but in
1792 he returned to Paris in the hope of rescuing the royal
prisoners. He lived among the French <i>émigrés</i> until the peace of
Amiens made it possible to return to Paris. Through Talleyrand&rsquo;s
influence he was able to remain in Paris after the war was
renewed, and he died there on the 23rd of November 1819.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He wrote, among other works, <i>The History, Religion, Learning

the Laws, Theology, Learning and Commerce of Ancient and

<p><span class="bold">CRAUFURD, ROBERT<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> (1764-1812), British major-general,
was born at Newark, Ayrshire, on the 5th of May 1764, and
entered the 25th Foot in 1779. As captain in the 75th regiment
he first saw active service against Tippoo Sahib in 1790-92. The
next year he was employed, under his brother Charles, with the
Austrian armies operating against the French. Returning to
England in 1797, he soon saw further service, as a lieutenant-colonel,
on Lake&rsquo;s staff in the Irish rebellion. A year later he was
British commissioner on Suvarov&rsquo;s staff when the Russians invaded
Switzerland, and at the end of 1799 was in the Helder expedition.
From 1801 to 1805 Lieutenant-Colonel Craufurd sat in parliament
for East Retford, but in 1807 he resumed active service with
Whitelock in the unfortunate Buenos Aires expedition. He was
almost the only one of the senior officers who added to his
reputation in this affair, and in 1808 he received a brigade
command under Sir John Moore. His regiments were heavily
engaged in the earlier part of the famous retreat, but were not
present at Corunna, having been detached to Vigo, whence they
returned to England. Later in 1809, once more in the Peninsula,
Brigadier-General Craufurd was three marches or more in rear
of Wellesley&rsquo;s army when a report came in that a great battle was
in progress. The march which followed is one almost unparalleled
in military annals. The three battalions of the
&ldquo;Light Brigade&rdquo; (43rd, 52nd and 95th) started in full marching
order, and arrived at the front on the day after the battle of
Talavera, having covered 62 m. in twenty-six hours. Beginning
their career with this famous march, these regiments and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
chief, under whom served such men as Charles and William
Napier, Shaw and Colborne, soon became celebrated as one of the
best corps of troops in Europe, and every engagement added to
their laurels. Craufurd&rsquo;s operations on the Coa and Agueda in
1810 were daring to the point of rashness, but he knew the
quality of the men he led better than his critics did, and though
Wellington censured him for his conduct, he at the same time
increased his force to a division by the addition of two picked
regiments of Portuguese <i>Caçadores</i>. The conduct of the renowned
&ldquo;Light Division&rdquo; at Busaco is described by Napier in one of his
most vivid passages. The winter of 1810-1811 Craufurd spent in
England, and his division was commanded in the interim by
another officer, who did not display much ability. He reappeared
on the field of the battle of Fuentes d&rsquo;Onoro amidst the cheers of
his men, and nothing could show his genius for war better than his
conduct on this day, in covering the strange readjustment of his
line which Wellington was compelled to make in the face of the
enemy. A little later he obtained major-general&rsquo;s rank; and on
the 19th of January 1812, as he stood on the glacis of Ciudad
Rodrigo, directing the stormers of the Light Division, he fell
mortally wounded. His body was carried out of action by his
staff officer, Lieutenant Shaw of the 43rd (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Shaw Kennedy</a></span>),
and, after lingering four days, he died. He was buried in the
breach of the fortress where he had met his death, and a
monument in St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral commemorates Craufurd and
Mackinnon, the two generals killed at the storming of Ciudad
Rodrigo. The exploits of Craufurd and the Light Division are
amongst the most cherished traditions of the British and
Portuguese armies. One of the quickest and most brilliant, if not
the very first, of Wellington&rsquo;s generals, he had a fiery temper,
which rendered him a difficult man to deal with, but to the day of
his death he possessed the confidence and affection of his men in
an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>His elder brother, Lieutenant-General Sir <span class="sc">Charles Craufurd</span>
(1761-1821), entered the 1st Dragoon Guards in 1778. Made
captain in the Queen&rsquo;s Bays in 1785, he became the equerry and
intimate friend of the duke of York. He studied in Germany for
some time, and, with his brother Robert&rsquo;s assistance, translated
Tielcke&rsquo;s book on the Seven Years&rsquo; War (<i>The Remarkable Events
of the War between Prussia, Austria and Russia from 1756 to 1763</i>).
As aide-de-camp he accompanied the duke of York to the French
War in 1793, and was at once sent as commissioner to the
Austrian headquarters, with which he was present at Neerwinden,
Caesar&rsquo;s Camp, Famars, Landrecies, &amp;c. Major in 1793, and
lieutenant-colonel in 1794, he returned to the English army in the
latter year, and on one occasion distinguished himself at the
head of two squadrons, taking 3 guns and 1000 prisoners. When
the British army left the continent Craufurd was again attached
to the Austrian army, and was present at the actions on the
Lahn, the combat of Neumarkt, and the battle of Amberg. At
the last battle a severe wound rendered him incapable of further
service, and cut short a promising career. He succeeded his
brother Robert as member of parliament for East Retford (1806-1812).
He died in 1821, having become a lieutenant-general and
a G.C.B.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAVAT<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (from the Fr. <i>cravate</i>, a corruption of &ldquo;Croat&rdquo;),
the name given by the French in the reign of Louis XIV. to the
scarf worn by the Croatian soldiers enlisted in the royal Croatian
regiment. Made of linen or muslin with broad edges of lace, it
became fashionable, and the name was applied both in England
and France to various forms of neckerchief worn at different
times, from the loosely tied lace cravat with long flowing ends,
called a &ldquo;Steinkirk&rdquo; from the battle of 1692 of that name, to the
elaborately folded and lightly starched linen or cambric neckcloth
worn during the period of Beau Brummell.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAVEN, PAULINE MARIE ARMANDE AGLAÉ<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (1808-1891),
French author, the daughter of an <i>émigré</i> Breton nobleman,
was born in London on the 12th of April 1808. Her father, the
comte Auguste de la Ferronays, was a close friend of the duc de
Berri, whom he accompanied on his return to France in 1814.
He and his wife were attached to the court of Charles X. at the
Tuileries, but a momentary quarrel with the duc de Berri made
retirement imperative to the count&rsquo;s sense of honour. He was
appointed ambassador at St Petersburg, and in 1827 became
foreign minister in Paris. Pauline was thus brought up in
brilliant surroundings, but her strongest impressions were those
which she derived from the group of Catholic thinkers gathered
round Lamennais, and her ardent piety furnishes the key of her
life. In 1828 her father was sent to Rome, and Pauline, at the
suggestion of Alexis Rio, the art critic, made her first literary
essay with a description of the emotions she experienced on a
visit to the catacombs. At the revolution of July, M. de la
Ferronays resigned his position, and retired with his family to
Naples. Here Pauline met her future husband, Augustus
Craven, who was then attaché to the British embassy. His
father, Keppel Richard Craven, the well-known supporter of
Queen Caroline, objected to his son&rsquo;s marriage with a Catholic;
but his scruples were overcome, and immediately after the
marriage (1834) Augustus Craven was received into the Roman
Catholic Church. Mrs Craven, whose family life as revealed in
the <i>Récit d&rsquo;une s&oelig;ur</i> was especially tender and intimate, suffered
several severe bereavements in the years following on her
marriage. The Cravens lived abroad until 1851, when the death
of Keppel Craven made his son practically independent of his
diplomatic career, in which he had not been conspicuously
successful. He stood unsuccessfully for election to parliament
for Dublin in 1852, and from that time retired into private life.
They went to live at Naples in 1853, and Mrs Craven began to
write the history of the family life of the la Ferronays between
1830 and 1836, its incidents being grouped round the love story
of her brother Albert and his wife Alexandrine. This book, the
<i>Récit d&rsquo;une s&oelig;ur</i> (1866, Eng. trans. 1868), was enthusiastically
received and was awarded a prize by the French Academy.
Straitened circumstances made it desirable for Mrs Craven to earn
money by her pen. <i>Anne Sévérin</i> appeared in 1868, <i>Fleurange</i> in
1871, <i>Le Mot d&rsquo;énigme</i> in 1874, <i>Le Valbriant</i> (Eng. trans., <i>Lucia</i>)
in 1886. Among her miscellaneous works may be mentioned
<i>La S&oelig;ur Natalie Narischkin</i> (1876), <i>Deux Incidents de la question
catholique en Angleterre</i> (1875), <i>Lady Georgiana Fullerton, sa
vie et ses &oelig;uvres</i> (1888). Mrs Craven&rsquo;s charming personality won
her many friends. She was a frequent guest with Lord
Palmerston, Lord Ellesmere and Lord Granville. She died in
Paris on the 1st of April 1891. Her husband, who died in 1884,
translated the correspondence of Lord Palmerston and of the
Prince Consort into French.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAVEN, WILLIAM CRAVEN,<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1608-1697), eldest
son of Sir William Craven, lord mayor of London, and of
Elizabeth, daughter of Alderman William Whitmore, was born in
June 1608, matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1623, and
joined the society of the Middle Temple in 1624. He had already
inherited his father&rsquo;s vast fortune by the latter&rsquo;s death in 1618,
and before he came of age he had distinguished himself in the
military service of the princes of Orange. Returning home he was
knighted and created Baron Craven of Hampstead Marshall in
Berkshire in 1627. He early showed enthusiasm for the cause of
the unfortunate king and queen of Bohemia, driven from their
dominions, and in 1632 joined Frederick in a military expedition
to recover the Palatinate, meeting Gustavus Adolphus at
Höchst, whose praise he gained by being the first, though
wounded, to mount the breach at the capture of Kreuznach on
the 22nd of February. The Swedish king, however, refused to
allow the elector an independent command for the defence of the
Palatinate, and Craven returned to England. In May 1633 he
was placed on the council of Wales. In 1637 he took part in a
second expedition in aid of the palatine family on the Lower
Rhine, with the young elector Charles Louis and his brother
Rupert, and offered as a contribution the sum of £30,000, but
their forces were defeated near Wessel and Craven wounded and
taken prisoner together with Rupert. He purchased his freedom
in 1639, and then joined the small court of the exiled queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
Elizabeth at the Hague and at Rhenen, supplying her generously
with funds on the cessation of her English pension owing to the
outbreak of the Civil War. He contributed also large sums in aid
of Charles I., and, after his execution, of Charles II., the amount
bestowed upon the latter being alone computed at £50,000,<a name="FnAnchor_1j" id="FnAnchor_1j" href="#Footnote_1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
notwithstanding that since 1651 the greater part of his estates had
been confiscated by the parliament and his house at Caversham
reduced to ruins.<a name="FnAnchor_2j" id="FnAnchor_2j" href="#Footnote_2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> At the Restoration he accompanied Charles to
England, regained his estates, and was rewarded with offices and
honours. He was made colonel of several regiments including
the Coldstream, and in 1667 lieutenant-general and also high
steward of Cambridge University. In 1666 he became a privy
councillor, but was not included later in 1679 in Sir William
Temple&rsquo;s remodelled council.<a name="FnAnchor_3j" id="FnAnchor_3j" href="#Footnote_3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In 1668 he became a governor of
the Charterhouse, was appointed lord-lieutenant of Middlesex, and
master of the Trinity House in 1670; and in 1673 a commissioner
for Tangier. He was one of the lords proprietors of Carolina and
a member of the Fishery Committee.</p>

<p>In March 1664 he was created viscount and earl of Craven.
Meanwhile his devotion to the interests of the queen of Bohemia
was unceasing, and on her return to England he offered her
hospitality at his house in Drury Lane, where she remained till
February 1662. At her death, within a fortnight afterwards, she
bequeathed to Craven her papers and her valuable collection of
portraits, but there is no foundation for the belief entertained
later that she had married him. In 1682 he became the guardian
of Ruperta, the natural daughter of his old comrade in arms,
Prince Rupert. He was again made a privy councillor and
lieutenant-general of the forces by James on his accession, and at
the age of eighty was in command of the Coldstreams at Whitehall
on the 17th of December 1688 when the Dutch troops arrived.
He refused to withdraw them at the bidding of Count Solms, the
Dutch commander, but obeyed later James&rsquo;s own orders to
retire. His public career now closed and he filled no office after
the revolution. Although his claims upon the gratitude of the
Stuart royal family were immense, Craven had never been
considered a possible candidate for high political place. His
ability was probably small, and he is spoken of with little respect
in the <i>Verney Papers</i> and by the electress Sophia in her <i>Memoirs</i>.
The latter retails some foolish observations made by Craven, and
Pepys was disgusted at his coarse and stupid jests at the Fishery
Board, where his &ldquo;very confused and very ridiculous proceedings&rdquo;
are also censured.<a name="FnAnchor_4j" id="FnAnchor_4j" href="#Footnote_4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> His military prowess, however, his generosity
and his public spirit are undoubted. He showed great activity
during the plague and fire of London. He was a patron of
letters and a member of the Royal Society. He inherited Combe
Abbey near Coventry from his father, and purchased Hampstead
Marshall in Berkshire, where he built a house on the model of
Heidelberg Castle.</p>

<p>He died unmarried on the 9th of April 1697, when the earldom
became extinct, the barony passing by special remainder to his
cousin William, 2nd Baron Craven; the present earl of Craven
(the earldom being revived in 1801) is descended from John, a
younger brother of the latter. The first Lord Craven&rsquo;s brother
John, who was created Baron Craven of Ryton in Shropshire and
who died in 1648, was the founder of the Craven scholarships
at Oxford and Cambridge universities, of which the first was
awarded in 1649.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAWFORD, EARLS OF.<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> The house of Lindsay, of which the
earl of Crawford is the head, traces its descent back to the barons
of Crawford who flourished in the 12th century, and has included
a number of men who have played leading parts in the history of
Scotland. It is said that &ldquo;though other families in Scotland may
have been of more historic, none can in genealogical importance
equal that of Lindsay,&rdquo; and the Lindsays claim that &ldquo;the predecessors
of the 1st earl of Crawford were barons at the period of
the earliest parliamentary records, and that, in fact, they were
never enrolled in the modern sense of the term, but were among
the <i>pares</i>, of which kings are <i>primi</i>, from the commencement of
recorded history.&rdquo; Again we are told, &ldquo;the earldom of Crawford,
therefore, like those of Douglas, of Moray, Ross, March and others
of the earlier times of feudalism, formed a petty principality, an
<i>imperium in imperio</i>.&rdquo; Moreover, the earls &ldquo;had also a <i>concilium</i>,
or petty parliament, consisting of the great vassals of the earldom,
with whose advice they acted on great and important occasions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir James Lindsay (d. 1396), 9th lord of Crawford in Lanarkshire,
was the only son of Sir James Lindsay, the 8th lord (d. c.
1357), and was related to King Robert II.; he was descended
from Sir Alexander Lindsay of Luffness (d. 1309), who obtained
Crawford and other estates in 1297 and who was high chamberlain
of Scotland. The 9th lord fought at Otterburn, and Froissart
tells of his wanderings after the fight. He was succeeded by his
cousin, Sir David Lindsay (c. 1360-1407), son of Sir Alexander
Lindsay of Glenesk (d. 1382), and in 1398 Sir David, who married
a daughter of Robert II., was made earl of Crawford.</p>

<p>The most important of the early earls of Crawford are the 4th
and the 5th earls. Alexander Lindsay, the 4th earl (d. 1454),
called the &ldquo;tiger earl,&rdquo; was, like his father David the 3rd earl,
who was killed in 1446, one of the most powerful of the Scottish
nobles; for some time he was in arms against King James II., but
he submitted in 1452. His son David, the 5th earl (c. 1440-1495),
was lord high admiral and lord chamberlain; he went
frequently as an ambassador to England and was created duke of
Montrose in 1488, but the title did not descend to his son.
Montrose fought for James III. at the battle of Sauchieburn, and
his son John, the 6th earl (d. 1513), was slain at Flodden.</p>

<p>David Lindsay, 8th earl of Crawford (d. 1542), son of
Alexander, the 7th earl (d. 1517), had a son Alexander, master of
Crawford (d. 1542), called the &ldquo;wicked master,&rdquo; who quarrelled
with his father and tried to kill him. Consequently he was
sentenced to death, and the 8th earl conveyed the earldom to his
kinsman, David Lindsay of Edzell (d. 1558), a descendant of the
3rd earl of Crawford, thus excluding Alexander and his descendants,
and in 1542 David became 9th earl of Crawford. But the
9th earl, although he had at least two sons, named the wicked
master&rsquo;s son David as his heir, and consequently in 1558 the
earldom came back to the elder line of the Lindsays, the 9th earl
being called the &ldquo;interpolated earl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Lindsay, 10th earl of Crawford (d. 1574), was a supporter
of Mary Queen of Scots; he was succeeded by his son David
(c. 1547-1607) as 11th earl. This David, a grandson of Cardinal
Beaton, was concerned in some of the risings under James VI.;
he was converted to Roman Catholicism and was in communication
with the Spaniards about an invasion of England. After his
death the earldom passed to his son David (d. 1621), a lawless
ruffian, and then to his brother, Sir Henry Lindsay or Charteris
(d. 1623), who became 13th earl of Crawford. Sir Henry&rsquo;s three
sons became in turn earls of Crawford, the youngest, Ludovic,
succeeding in 1639.</p>

<p>Ludovic Lindsay, 16th earl of Crawford (1600-1652), took part
in the strange plot of 1641 called the &ldquo;incident.&rdquo; Having
joined Charles I. at Nottingham in 1642, he fought at Edgehill, at
Newbury and elsewhere during the Civil War; in 1644, just after
Marston Moor, the Scottish parliament declared he had forfeited
his earldom, and, following the lines laid down when this was
regranted in 1642, it was given to John Lindsay, 1st earl of
Lindsay. Ludovic was taken prisoner at Newcastle in 1644 and
was condemned to death, but the sentence was not carried out,
and in 1645 he was released by Montrose, under whom he served
until the surrender of the king at Newark. Later he was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>
Ireland and in Spain and he died probably in France in 1652.
He left no issue.</p>

<p>The earl of Lindsay, who thus supplanted his kinsman,
belonged to the family of Lindsay of the Byres, a branch of the
Lindsays descended from Sir David Lindsay of Crawford (d. c.
1355), the grandfather of the 1st earl of Crawford. Sir David&rsquo;s
descendant, Sir John Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1482), was created
a lord of parliament as Lord Lindsay of the Byres in 1445, and
his son David, the 2nd lord (d. 1490), fought for James III. at the
battle of Sauchieburn. The most prominent member of this line
was Patrick, 6th Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1589), a son of
John the 5th lord (d. 1563), who was a temperate member of the
reforming party. Patrick was one of the first of the Scottish
nobles to join the reformers, and he was also one of the most
violent. He fought against the regent, Mary of Lorraine, and the
French; then during a temporary reconciliation he assisted
Mary, queen of Scots, to crush the northern rebels at Corrichie in
1562, but again among the enemies of the queen he took part in
the murder of David Rizzio and signed the bond against Bothwell,
whom he wished to meet in single combat after the affair at
Carberry Hill in 1565. Lindsay, who was a brother-in-law and
ally of the regent Murray, carried Mary to Lochleven castle and
obtained her signature to the deed of abdication; he fought
against her at Langside, and after Murray&rsquo;s murder he was one
of the chiefs of the party which supported the throne of James
VI. In 1578, however, he was among those who tried to drive
Morton from power, and in 1582 he helped to seize the person of
the king in the plot called the &ldquo;raid of Ruthven,&rdquo; afterwards
escaping to England. Lindsay had returned to Scotland when
he died on the 11th of December 1589. His successor was his son,
James the 7th lord (d. 1601).</p>

<p>Patrick&rsquo;s great-grandson, John Lindsay, 17th earl of Crawford
and 1st earl of Lindsay (c. 1598-1678), was the son of Robert
Lindsay, 9th Lord Lindsay of the Byres, whom he succeeded as
10th lord in 1616. In 1633 he was created earl of Lindsay, and
having become a leader of the Covenanters he marched with the
Scottish army into England in 1644 and was present at Marston
Moor; in 1644 also he obtained the earldom of Crawford in the
manner already mentioned. In the same year he became lord
high treasurer of Scotland, and in 1645 president of the parliament.
Having fought against Montrose at Kilsyth, the earl of
Crawford-Lindsay, as he was called, changed sides, and in 1647
he signed the &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; for the release of Charles I.,
losing all his offices by the act of classes when his enemy, the
marquess of Argyll, obtained the upper hand. After the defeat
of the Scots at Dunbar, however, Crawford regained his influence
in Scottish politics, but from 1651 to 1660 he was a prisoner in
England. In 1661 he was restored to his former dignities, but his
refusal to abjure the covenant compelled him to resign them two
years later. His son, William, 18th earl of Crawford and 2nd
earl of Lindsay (1644-1698), was, like his father, an ardent
covenanter; in 1690 he was president of the Convention parliament.
Mr Andrew Lang says this earl was &ldquo;very poor, very
presbyterian, and his letters, almost alone among those of the
statesmen of the period, are rich in the texts and unctuous style
of an older generation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William&rsquo;s grandson, John Lindsay, 20th earl of Crawford and
4th earl of Lindsay (1702-1749), won a high reputation as a
soldier. He held a command in the Russian army, seeing service
against the Turk, and he also served against the same foe under
Prince Eugene. Having returned to the English army he led the
life-guards at Dettingen and distinguished himself at Fontenoy;
later he served against France in the Netherlands. He left no
sons when he died in December 1749, and his kinsman, George
Crawford-Lindsay, 4th Viscount Garnock (c. 1723-1781), a
descendant of the 17th earl, became 21st earl of Crawford and
5th earl of Lindsay. When George&rsquo;s son, George, the 22nd earl
(1758-1808), died unmarried in January 1808, the earldoms of
Crawford and Lindsay were separated, George&rsquo;s kinsman, David
Lindsay (d. 1809), a descendant of the 4th Lord Lindsay of
the Byres, becoming 7th earl of Lindsay. Both David and his
successor Patrick (d. 1839) died without sons, and in 1878 the
House of Lords decided that Sir John Trotter Bethune, Bart.
(1827-1894), also a descendant of the 4th Lord Lindsay of the
Byres, was entitled to the earldom. In 1894 John&rsquo;s cousin,
David Clark Bethune (b. 1832), became 11th earl of Lindsay.</p>

<p>The earldom of Crawford remained dormant from 1808, when
this separation took place, until 1848, when the House of Lords
adjudged it to James Lindsay, 7th earl of Balcarres.</p>

<p>The earls of Balcarres are descended from John Lindsay, Lord
Menmuir (1552-1598), a younger son of David Lindsay, 9th
earl of Crawford. John, who bought the estate of Balcarres in
Fifeshire, became a lord of session as Lord Menmuir in 1581; he
was a member of the Scottish privy council and one of the commissioners
of the treasury called the Octavians. He had great
influence with James VI., helping the king to restore episcopacy
after he had become, in 1595, keeper of the privy seal and a
secretary of state. Menmuir, a man of great intellectual attainments,
left two sons, the younger, David, succeeding to the
family estates on his brother&rsquo;s death in 1601. David (c. 1586-1641),
a notable alchemist, was created Lord Lindsay of Balcarres
in 1633, and in 1651 his son Alexander was made earl of Balcarres.</p>

<p>Alexander Lindsay, 1st earl of Balcarres (1618-1659), the
&ldquo;Rupert of the Covenant,&rdquo; fought against Charles I. at Marston
Moor, at Alford and at Kilsyth, but later he joined the royalists,
signing the &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; for the release of the king in 1647,
and having been created earl of Balcarres took part in Glencairn&rsquo;s
rising in 1653. Richard Baxter speaks very highly of the earl,
who died at Breda in August 1659. His son Charles (d. 1662)
became 2nd earl of Balcarres, and another son, Colin (c. 1654-1722),
became 3rd earl. Colin, who was perhaps the most
trusted of the advisers of James II., wrote some valuable <i>Memoirs
touching the Revolution in Scotland, 1688-1690</i>; these were first
published in 1714, and were edited for the Bannatyne Club by the
25th earl of Crawford in 1841. Having been allowed to return to
Scotland after an exile in France, the earl joined the Jacobite
rising in 1715. His successor was his son Alexander, the 4th
earl (d. 1736), who was followed by another son, James, the 5th
earl (1691-1768), who fought for the Stuarts at Sheriffmuir.
Afterwards James was pardoned and entered the English army,
serving under George II. at Dettingen. This earl wrote some
<i>Memoirs of the Lindsays</i>, which were completed by his son
Alexander, the 6th earl (1752-1825). Alexander was with the
English troops in America during the struggle for independence,
and was governor of Jamaica from 1794 to 1801, filling a difficult
position with great credit to himself. He became a general in
1803, and died at Haigh Hall, near Wigan, which he had received
through his wife, Elizabeth Dalrymple (1759-1816), on the 27th
of May 1825. This earl did not claim the earldom of Crawford,
although he became earl <i>de jure</i> in 1808, but in 1843 his son James
Lindsay (1783-1869) did so, and in 1848 the claim was allowed by
the House of Lords. James was thus 24th earl of Crawford and
7th earl of Balcarres; in 1826 he had been created a peer of the
United Kingdom as Baron Wigan of Haigh Hall.</p>

<p>His son, Alexander William Crawford Lindsay, 25th earl of
Crawford (1812-1880), was born at Muncaster Castle, Cumberland,
on the 16th of October 1812, and educated at Eton and Cambridge.
He travelled much in Europe and the East, and was
most learned in genealogy and history. His more important
works include <i>Lives of the Lindsays</i> (3 vols., 1849), <i>Letters on
Egypt, Edom and the Holy Land</i> (1838), <i>Sketches of the History of
Christian Art</i> (1847 and 1882), <i>Etruscan Inscriptions Analysed</i>
(1872), and <i>The Earldom of Mar during 500 years</i> (1882). He
succeeded to the title in September 1869, and died at Florence
on the 13th of December 1880. A year later it was discovered
that the family vault at Dunecht had been broken into and the
body stolen. It was not until the 18th of July 1882 that the
police, acting on the confession of an eye-witness of the desecration,
found the remains, which were then reinterred at Haigh
Hall, Wigan.</p>

<p>His only son, James Ludovic Lindsay, 26th earl of Crawford
(1847-&emsp;&emsp;), British astronomer and orientalist, was born at St
Germain-en-Laye, France, on the 28th of July 1847. Educated
at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he devoted himself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
astronomy, in which he early achieved distinction. In 1870 he
went to Cadiz to observe the eclipse of the sun, and, in 1874, to
Mauritius to observe the transit of Venus. In the interval,
with the assistance of his father, he had built an observatory
at Dunecht, Aberdeenshire, which in 1888 he presented,
together with his unique library of astronomical and mathematical
works, to the New Royal Observatory on Blackford Hill,
Edinburgh, where they were installed in 1895. His services to
science were recognized by his election to the presidentship of
the Royal Astronomical Society in 1878 and 1879 in succession
to Sir William Huggins, and to the fellowship of the Royal
Society in 1878. He also received the degree of LL.D. from
Edinburgh University in 1882, and in the following year was
nominated honorary associate of the Royal Prussian Academy of
Sciences. An enthusiastic bibliophile, he became a trustee of the
British Museum, and acted for a term as president of the Library
Association. To the free library of Wigan, Lancashire, he gave a
series of oriental and English MSS. of the 9th to the 19th centuries
in illustration of the progress of handwriting, while for the use of
specialists and students he issued the invaluable <i>Bibliotheca
Lindesiana</i>. He represented Wigan in the House of Commons
from 1874 till his succession to the title in 1880.</p>

<p>Another title held by the Lindsays was that of Spynie, Sir
Alexander Lindsay (c. 1555-1607), created Baron Spynie in
1590, being a younger son of the 10th earl of Crawford. The 2nd
Lord Spynie was Alexander&rsquo;s son, Alexander (d. 1646), who
served in Germany under Gustavus Adolphus and assisted
Charles I. in Scotland during the Civil War; and the 3rd lord
was the latter&rsquo;s son, George. When George, a royalist who was
taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester, died in 1671 this title
became extinct.</p>

<p>The dukedom of Montrose, which had lapsed on the death of
the 5th earl of Crawford in 1495 and had been revived in 1707 in
the Graham family, was claimed in 1848 by the 24th earl of
Crawford, but in 1853 the House of Lords gave judgment
against the earl.</p>

<p>The Lindsays have furnished the Scottish church with several
prelates. John Lindsay (d. 1335) was bishop of Glasgow;
Alexander Lindsay (d. 1639) was bishop of Dunkeld until he
was deposed in 1638; David Lindsay (d. c. 1641) was bishop
of Brechin and then of Edinburgh until he, too, was deposed in
1638; and a similar fate attended Patrick Lindsay (1566-1644),
bishop of Ross from 1613 to 1633 and archbishop of Glasgow
from 1633 to 1638. Perhaps the most famous of the Lindsay
prelates was David Lindsay (c. 1531-1613), a nephew of the
9th earl of Crawford. David, who married James VI. to Anne of
Denmark at Upsala, was one of the leaders of the Kirk party; he
became bishop of Ross under the new scheme for establishing
episcopacy in 1600.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAWFORD, FRANCIS MARION<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> (1854-1909), American
author, was born at Bagni di Lucca, Italy, on the 2nd of August
1854, being the son of the American sculptor Thomas Crawford
(<i>q.v.</i>), and the nephew of Julia Ward Howe, the American poet.
He studied successively at St Paul&rsquo;s school, Concord, New
Hampshire; Cambridge University; Heidelberg; and Rome.
In 1879 he went to India, where he studied Sanskrit and edited
the Allahabad <i>Indian Herald</i>. Returning to America he continued
to study Sanskrit at Harvard University for a year,
contributed to various periodicals, and in 1882 produced his first
novel, <i>Mr Isaacs</i>, a brilliant sketch of modern Anglo-Indian life
mingled with a touch of Oriental mystery. This book had an
immediate success, and its author&rsquo;s promise was confirmed by the
publication of <i>Dr Claudius</i> (1883). After a brief residence in
New York and Boston, in 1883 he returned to Italy, where he
made his permanent home. This accounts perhaps for the fact
that, in spite of his nationality, Marion Crawford&rsquo;s books stand
apart from any distinctively American current in literature.
Year by year he published a number of successful novels: <i>A
Roman Singer</i> (1884), <i>An American Politician</i> (1884), <i>To Leeward</i>
(1884), <i>Zoroaster</i> (1885), <i>A Tale of a Lonely Parish</i> (1886),
<i>Marzio&rsquo;s Crucifix</i> (1887), <i>Saracinesca</i> (1887), <i>Paul Patoff</i> (1887),
<i>With the Immortals</i> (1888), <i>Greifenstein</i> (1889), <i>Sant&rsquo; Ilario</i> (1889),
<i>A Cigarette-maker&rsquo;s Romance</i> (1890), <i>Khaled</i> (1891), <i>The Witch of
Prague</i> (1891), <i>The Three Fates</i> (1892), <i>The Children of the King</i>
(1892), <i>Don Orsino</i> (1892), <i>Marion Darche</i> (1893), <i>Pietro Ghisleri</i>
(1893), <i>Katharine Lauderdale</i> (1894), <i>Love in Idleness</i> (1894), <i>The
Ralstons</i>, (1894), <i>Casa Braccio</i> (1895), <i>Adam Johnston&rsquo;s Son</i>
(1895), <i>Taquisara</i> (1896), <i>A Rose of Yesterday</i> (1897), <i>Corleone</i>
(1897), <i>Via Crucis</i> (1899), <i>In the Palace of the King</i> (1900),
<i>Marietta</i> (1901), <i>Cecilia</i> (1902), <i>Whosoever Shall Offend</i> (1904),
<i>Soprano</i> (1905), <i>A Lady of Rome</i> (1906). He also published the
historical works, <i>Ave Roma Immortalis</i> (1898), <i>Rulers of the
South</i> (1900)&mdash;renamed <i>Sicily, Calabria and Malta</i> in 1904,&mdash;and
<i>Gleanings from Venetian History</i> (1905). In these his intimate
knowledge of local Italian history combines with the romancist&rsquo;s
imaginative faculty to excellent effect. But his place in contemporary
literature depends on his novels. He was a gifted
narrator, and his books of fiction, full of historic vitality and
dramatic characterization, became widely popular among
readers to whom the realism of &ldquo;problems&rdquo; or the eccentricities
of subjective analysis were repellent, for he could unfold a
romantic story in an attractive way, setting his plot amid
picturesque surroundings, and gratifying the reader&rsquo;s intelligence
by a style at once straightforward and accomplished. The
<i>Saracinesca</i> series shows him perhaps at his best. <i>A Cigarette-maker&rsquo;s
Romance</i> was dramatized, and had considerable popularity
on the stage as well as in its novel form; and in 1902 an
original play from his pen, <i>Francesco da Rimini</i>, was produced in
Paris by Sarah Bernhardt. He died at Sorrento on the 9th of
April 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAWFORD, THOMAS<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> (1814-1857), American sculptor, was
born of Irish parents in New York on the 22nd of March 1814.
He showed at an early age great taste for art, and learnt to draw
and to carve in wood. In his nineteenth year he entered the
studio of a firm of monumental sculptors in his native city; and
in the summer of 1835 he went to Rome and became a pupil of
Thorwaldsen. The first work which made him generally known
as a man of genius was his group of &ldquo;Orpheus entering Hades
in Search of Eurydice,&rdquo; executed in 1839. This was followed by
other poetical sculptures, among which were the &ldquo;Babes in the
Wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Flora,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hebe and Ganymede,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sappho,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vesta,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Dancers,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hunter.&rdquo; Among his statues and busts
are especially noteworthy the bust of Josiah Quincy, executed
for Harvard University (now in the Boston Athenaeum), the
equestrian statue of Washington at Richmond, Virginia, the
statue of Beethoven in the Boston music hall, statues of Channing
and Henry Clay, and the colossal figure of &ldquo;Armed Liberty&rdquo; for
the Capitol at Washington. For this building he executed also
the figures for the pediment and began the bas-reliefs for the
bronze doors, which were afterwards completed by W. H.
Rinehart. The groups of the pediment symbolize the progress
of civilization in America. Crawford&rsquo;s works include a large
number of bas-reliefs of Scriptural subjects taken from both the
Old and the New Testaments. He made Rome his home, but he
visited several times his native land&mdash;first in 1844 (in which year
he married Louisa Ward), next in 1849, and lastly in 1856. He
died in London on the 10th of October 1857.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAWFORD, WILLIAM HARRIS<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (1772-1834), American
statesman, was born in Amherst county, Virginia, on the 24th of
February 1772. When he was seven his parents moved into
Edgefield district, South Carolina, and four years later into
Columbus county, Georgia. The death of his father in 1788 left
the family in reduced circumstances, and William made what he
could by teaching school for six years. He then studied at
Carmel Academy for two years, was principal, for a time, of one
of the largest schools in Augusta, and in 1798 was admitted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
bar. From 1800 to 1802, with Horatio Marbury, he prepared a
digest of the laws of Georgia from 1755 to 1800. From 1803 to
1807 he was a member of the State House of Representatives,
becoming during this period the leader of one of two personal-political
factions in the state that long continued in bitter
strife, occasioning his fighting two duels, in one of which he
killed his antagonist, and in the other was wounded in his wrist.
From 1807 to 1813 he was a member of the United States Senate,
of which he was president <i>pro tempore</i> from March 1812 to March
1813. In 1813 he declined the offer of the post of secretary of
war, but from that year until 1815 was minister to the court
of France. He was then secretary of war in 1815-1816, and
secretary of the treasury from 1816 to 1825. In 1816 in the
congressional caucus which nominated James Monroe for the
presidency Crawford was a strong opposing candidate, a
majority being at first in his favour, but when the vote was
finally cast 65 were for Monroe and 54 for Crawford. In 1824,
when the congressional caucus was fast becoming extinct,
Crawford, being prepared to control it, insisted that it should
be held, but of 216 Republicans only 66 attended; of these, 64
voted for Crawford. Three other candidates, however, Andrew
Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay, were otherwise
put in the field. During the campaign Crawford was stricken
with paralysis, and when the electoral vote was cast Jackson
received 99, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37. It remained
for the house of representatives to choose from Jackson, Adams
and Crawford, and through Clay&rsquo;s influence Adams became
president. Crawford was invited by Adams to continue as
secretary of the treasury, but declined. He recovered his health
sufficiently to become (in 1827) a circuit judge in his own state,
but died while on circuit, in Elberton, Georgia, on the 15th of
September 1834. In his day he was undoubtedly one of the
foremost political leaders of the country, but his reputation has
not stood the test of time. He was of imposing presence and had
great conversational powers; but his inflexible integrity was not
sufficiently tempered by tact and civility to admit of his winning
general popularity. Consequently, although a skilful political
organizer, he incurred the bitter enmity of other leaders of his
time&mdash;Jackson, Adams and Calhoun. He won the admiration of
Albert Gallatin and others by his powerful support of the movement
in 1811 to recharter the Bank of the United States; he
earned the condemnation of posterity by his authorship in 1820 of
the four-years-term law, which limited the term of service of
thousands of public officials to four years, and did much to
develop the &ldquo;spoils system.&rdquo; He was a Liberal Democrat, and
advised the calling of a constitutional convention as preferable to
nullification or secession.</p>

Indianapolis. Pop. (1890) 6089; (1900) 6649, including 230
negroes and 221 foreign-born; (1910) 9371. It is served by the
Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville, the Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago &amp; St Louis, and the Vandalia railways, and by interurban
electric lines. Wabash College, founded here in 1832 by Presbyterian
missionaries but now non-sectarian, had in 1908 27
instructors, 345 students, and a library of 43,000 volumes.
Among manufactures are flour, iron, wagons and carriages,
acetylene lights, wire and nails, matches, brick paving blocks, and
electrical machinery. North-east of the city there are valuable
mineral springs, from which the city obtains its water-supply.
Crawfordsville, named in honour of W. H. Crawford, was first
settled about 1820, was laid out as a town in 1823, and was
chartered as a city in 1863. It was for many years the home of

<p><span class="bold">CRAYER, GASPARD DE<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1582-1669), Flemish painter, was
born at Antwerp, and learnt the art of painting from Raphael
Coxcie. He matriculated in the guild of St Luke at Brussels in
1607, resided in the capital of Brabant till after 1660, and finally
settled at Ghent. Amongst the numerous pictures which he
painted in Ghent, one in the town museum represents the
martyrdom of St Blaise, and bears the inscription A° 1668 aet.
86. Crayer was one of the most productive yet one of the most
conscientious artists of the later Flemish school, second to
Rubens in vigour and below Vandyck in refinement, but nearly
equalling both in most of the essentials of painting. He was well
known and always well treated by Albert and Isabella, governors
of the Netherlands. The cardinal-infant Ferdinand made him a
court-painter. His pictures abound in the churches and museums
of Brussels and Ghent; and there is scarcely a country chapel in
Flanders or Brabant that cannot boast of one or more of his
canvases. But he was equally respected beyond his native
country; and some important pictures of his composition are to
be found as far south as Aix in Provence and as far east as
Amberg in the Upper Palatinate. His skill as a decorative artist
is shown in the panels executed for a triumphal arch at the entry
of Cardinal Ferdinand into the Flemish capital, some of which
are publicly exhibited in the museum of Ghent. Crayer died at
Ghent. His best works are the &ldquo;Miraculous Draught of Fishes&rdquo;
in the gallery of Brussels, the &ldquo;Judgment of Solomon&rdquo; in the
gallery of Ghent, and &ldquo;Madonnas with Saints&rdquo; in the Louvre,
the Munich Pinakothek, and the Belvedere at Vienna. His
portrait by Vandyck was engraved by P. Pontius.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAYFISH<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (Fr. <i>écrevisse</i>), the name of freshwater crustaceans
closely allied to and resembling the lobsters, and, like them,
belonging to the order Macrura. They are divided into two
families, the <i>Astacidae</i> and <i>Parastacidae</i>, inhabiting respectively
the northern and the southern hemispheres.</p>

<p>The crayfishes of England and Ireland (<i>Astacus</i>, or <i>Potamobius</i>,
<i>pallipes</i>) are generally about 3 or 4 in. long, of a dull green or
brownish colour above and paler brown or yellowish below. They
are abundant in some rivers, especially where the rocks are of a
calcareous nature, sheltering under stones or in burrows which
they dig for themselves in the banks and coming out at night in
search of food. They are omnivorous feeders, killing and eating
insects, snails, frogs and other animals, and devouring any carrion
that comes in their way. It is stated that they sometimes come
on land in search of vegetable food.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">Crayfish (<i>Cambarus</i> sp.) from the Mississippi River. (After Morse.)</td></tr></table>

<p>On the continent of Europe, <i>Astacus pallipes</i> occurs chiefly in
the west and south, being found in France, Spain, Italy and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
Balkan Peninsula. It is known in France as <i>écrevisse à pattes
blanches</i> and in Germany as <i>Steinkrebs</i>, and is little used as food.
The larger <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i> (<i>écrevisse à pattes rouges</i>, <i>Edelkrebs</i>)
is not found in Britain, but occurs in France and Germany,
southern Sweden, Russia, &amp;c. It is distinguished, among other
characters, by the red colour of the under side of the large claws.
It is the species most highly esteemed for the table. Other
species of the genus are found in central and eastern Europe and
as far east as Turkestan. Farther east a gap occurs in the
distribution and no crayfishes are met with till the basin of the
Amur is reached, where a group of species occurs, extending
into northern Japan. In North America, west of the Rocky
Mountains, the genus <i>Astacus</i> again appears, but east of the
watershed it is replaced by the genus <i>Cambarus</i>, which is represented
by very numerous species, ranging from the Great Lakes
to Mexico. Several blind species inhabit the subterranean
waters of caves. The best known is <i>Cambarus pellucidus</i>,
found in the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The area of distribution occupied by the southern crayfishes or
<i>Parastacidae</i> is separated by a broad equatorial zone from that of
the northern group, unless, as has been asserted, the two come
into contact or overlap in Central America. None is found in any
part of Africa, though a species occurs in Madagascar. They are
absent also from the oriental region of zoologists, but reappear
in Australia and New Zealand. Some of the Australian species,
such as the &ldquo;Murray River lobster&rdquo; (<i>Astacopsis spinifer</i>), are of
large size and are used for food. In South America crayfishes
are found in southern Brazil, Argentina and Chile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRAYON<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (Fr. <i>craie</i>, chalk, from Lat. <i>creta</i>), a coloured material
for drawing, employed generally in the form of pencils, but
sometimes also as a powder, and consisting of native earthy and
stony friable substances, or of artificially prepared mixtures of a
base of pipe or china clay with Prussian blue, orpiment, vermilion,
umber and other pigments. Calcined gypsum, talc and compounds
of magnesium, bismuth and lead are occasionally used as
bases. The required shades of tints are obtained by adding
varying amounts of colouring matter to equal quantities of the
base. Crayons are used by the artist to make groupings of
colours and to secure landscape and other effects with ease and
rapidity. The outline as well as the rest of the picture is drawn in
crayon. The colours are softened off and blended by the finger,
with the assistance of a stump of leather or paper; and shading is
produced by cross-hatching and stippling. The art of painting in
crayon or pastel is supposed to have originated in Germany in the
17th century. By Johann Alexander Thiele (1685-1752) it was
carried to great perfection, and in France it was early practised
with much success. Amongst the earlier pastellists may be
mentioned Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757), W. Hoare (1707-1792),
F. Cotes (1726-1770), and J. Russell (1744-1806); and in recent
years the art has been successfully revived. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pastel</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREASY, SIR EDWARD SHEPHERD<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1812-1878), English
historian, was born at Bexley in Kent, and educated at Eton
and King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. He became a fellow of King&rsquo;s
College in 1834, and having been called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn three years later, was made assistant judge at the Westminster
sessions court. In 1840 he was appointed professor of
modern and ancient history in the university of London, and in
1860 became chief justice of Ceylon and a knight. Broken down
in health he returned to England in 1870, and after a further but
short stay in Ceylon died in London on the 27th of January 1878.
Creasy&rsquo;s most popular work is his <i>Fifteen decisive Battles of the
World</i>, which, first published in 1851, has passed through many
editions. He also wrote <i>The History of the Ottoman Turks</i>

<p><span class="bold">CREATIANISM AND TRADUCIANISM.<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> Traducianism is the
doctrine about the origin of the soul which was taught by
Tertullian in his <i>De anima</i>&mdash;that souls are generated from souls
in the same way and at the same time as bodies from bodies:
creatianism is the doctrine that God creates a soul for each
body that is generated. The Pelagians taunted the upholders of
original sin with holding Tertullian&rsquo;s opinion, and called them
Traduciani (from <i>tradux</i>: vid. Du Cange s. vv.), a name which was
perhaps suggested by a metaphor in <i>De an.</i> 19, where the soul is
described &ldquo;velut surculus quidam ex matrice Adam in propaginem
deducta.&rdquo; Hence we have formed &ldquo;traducianist,&rdquo; &ldquo;traducianism,&rdquo;
and by analogy &ldquo;creatianist,&rdquo; &ldquo;creatianism.&rdquo; Augustine
denied that traducianism was necessarily connected with the
doctrine of original sin, and to the end of his life was unable to
decide for or against it. His letter to Jerome (<i>Epist. Clas.</i> iii.
166) is a most valuable statement of his difficulties. Jerome
condemned it, and said that creatianism was the opinion of the
Church, though he admitted that most of the Western Christians
held traducianism. The question has never been authoritatively
determined, but creatianism, which had always prevailed in the
East, became the general opinion of the medieval theologians,
and Peter Lombard&rsquo;s <i>creando infundit animas Deus et infundendo
creat</i> was an accepted formula. Luther, like Augustine, was
undecided, but Lutherans have as a rule been traducianists.
Calvin favoured creatianism.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Peter Lombard&rsquo;s phrase perhaps shows that even in his time it
was felt that some union of the two opinions was needed, and
Augustine&rsquo;s toleration pointed in the same direction, for the traducianism
he thought possible was one in which God <i>operatur institutas
administrando non novas instituendo naturas</i> (<i>Ep.</i> 166. 5. 11).
Modern psychologists teach that while &ldquo;personality&rdquo; can be discerned
in its &ldquo;becoming,&rdquo; nothing is known of its origin. Lotze,
however, who may be taken as representing the believers in the
immanence of the divine Being, puts forth&mdash;but as a &ldquo;dim conjecture&rdquo;&mdash;something
very like creatianism (<i>Microcosmus</i>, bk. iii.
chap. v. ad fin.). It is still, as in the days of Augustine, a question
whether a more exact division of man into body, soul <i>and spirit</i> may
help to throw light on this subject.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÉBILLON, PROSPER JOLYOT DE<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (1674-1762), French
tragic poet, was born on the 13th of January 1674 at Dijon,
where his father, Melchior Jolyot, was notary-royal. Having
been educated at the Jesuits&rsquo; school of the town, and at the
Collège Mazarin, he became an advocate, and was placed in the
office of a lawyer named Prieur at Paris. With the encouragement
of his master, son of an old friend of Scarron&rsquo;s, he produced
a <i>Mort des enfants de Brutus</i>, which, however, he failed to bring
upon the stage. But in 1705 he succeeded with <i>Idoménée</i>; in
1707 his <i>Atrée et Thyeste</i> was repeatedly acted at court; <i>Électre</i>
appeared in 1709; and in 1711 he produced his finest play, the
<i>Rhadamiste et Zénobie</i>, which is his masterpiece and held the
stage for a long period, although the plot is so complicated as
to be almost incomprehensible. But his <i>Xerxes</i> (1714) was only
once played, and his <i>Sémiramis</i> (1717) was an absolute failure.
In 1707 Crébillon had married a girl without fortune, who had
since died, leaving him two young children. His father also had
died, insolvent. His three years&rsquo; attendance at court had been
fruitless. Envy had circulated innumerable slanders against him.
Oppressed with melancholy, he removed to a garret, where he
surrounded himself with a number of dogs, cats and ravens,
which he had befriended; he became utterly careless of cleanliness
or food, and solaced himself with constant smoking. But in
1731, in spite of his long seclusion, he was elected member of the
French Academy; in 1735 he was appointed royal censor; and in
1745 Mme de Pompadour presented him with a pension of 1000
francs and a post in the royal library. He returned to the stage
in 1726 with a successful play, <i>Pyrrhus</i>; in 1748 his <i>Catilina</i> was
played with great success before the court; and in 1754, when he
was eighty years old, appeared his last tragedy, <i>Le Triumvirat</i>.
Crébillon died on the 17th of June 1754. The enemies of Voltaire
maintained that Crébillon was his superior as a tragic poet.
The spirit of rivalry thus provoked induced Voltaire to take the
subjects of no less than five of Crébillon&rsquo;s tragedies&mdash;<i>Sémiramis</i>,
<i>Électre</i>, <i>Catilina</i>, <i>Le Triumvirat</i>, <i>Atrée</i>&mdash;as subjects for tragedies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
of his own. The so-called <i>Éloge de Crébillon</i> (1762), really a
depreciation, which appeared in the year of the poet&rsquo;s death, is
generally attributed to Voltaire, though he strenuously denied
the authorship. Crébillon&rsquo;s drama is marked by a force too often
gained at the expense of scenes of unnatural horror; his pieces
show lack of culture and a want of care which displays itself even
in the mechanism of his verse, though fine isolated passages are
not infrequent.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are numerous editions of his works, among which may be
noticed: <i>&OElig;uvres</i> (1772), with preface and &ldquo;éloge,&rdquo; by Joseph de la
Porte; <i>&OElig;uvres</i> (1828), containing D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s <i>Éloge de Crébillon</i>
(1775); and <i>Théâtre complet</i> (1885) with a notice by Auguste Vitu.
A complete bibliography is given by Maurice Dutrait, in his <i>Étude
sur la vie et le théâtre de Crébillon</i> (1895).</p>
</div>

<p>His only son, <span class="sc">Claude Prosper Jolyot Crébillon</span> (1707-1777),
French novelist, was born at Paris on the 14th of February
1707. His life was spent almost entirely in Paris, but the
publication of <i>L&rsquo;Écumoire, ou Tanzaï et Neadarné, histoire
japonaise</i> (1734), which contained veiled attacks on the bull
<i>Unigenitus</i>, the cardinal de Rohan and the duchesse du Maine,
brought Crébillon into disgrace. He was first imprisoned and
afterwards forced to live in exile for five years at Sens and
elsewhere. With Alexis Piron and Charles Collé he founded in
1752 the gay society which met regularly to dine at the famous
&ldquo;Caveau,&rdquo; where many good stories were elaborated. From
1759 onwards he was to be found at the Wednesday dinners of the
Pelletier, at which Garrick, Sterne and Wilkes were sometimes
guests. He married in 1748 an English lady of noble family,
Lady Henrietta Maria Stafford, who had been his mistress from
1744. Their life is said to have been passed in much affection
and mutual fidelity; and there could be no greater contrast than
that between Crébillon&rsquo;s private life and the tone of his novels,
the immorality of which lent irony to the author&rsquo;s tenure of the
office of censor, bestowed on him in 1759 through the favour of
Mme de Pompadour. He died in Paris on the 12th of April 1777.
The most famous of his numerous novels are: <i>Les Amours de
Zéokinizul, roi des Kofirans</i> (1740), in which &ldquo;Zéokinizul&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kofirans&rdquo; may be translated Louis XIV. and the French
respectively; and <i>Le Sopha, conte moral</i> (1740), where the moral
is supplied in the title only. This last novel is given by some
authorities as the reason for his imprisonment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>&OElig;uvres</i> were collected and printed in 1772. See a notice of
Crébillon prefixed to O. Uzanne&rsquo;s edition of his <i>Contes dialogués</i> in
the series of <i>Conteurs du XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>. Crébillon&rsquo;s novels might
be pronounced immoral to the last degree if it were not that two
writers slightly later in date surpassed even his achievements in this
particular. André Robert de Nerciat (1739-1800) produced under
a false name a number of licentious tales, and was followed by
Donatien, marquis de Sade.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÈCHE<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (Fr. for a &ldquo;crib&rdquo; or cradle), the name given to a
day-nursery, a public institution for the feeding and care of
infants while the mothers are engaged in work outside their
homes, or are otherwise prevented from giving them proper
attention. Infants are usually admitted when over a month old,
and are kept till they are capable of looking after themselves.
The advantages of such institutions are that the attention of
skilled and trained nurses is given to the children, the food is
better and more adapted to their needs than that given in their
homes, the surroundings are cleaner and healthier, and habits of
discipline and cleanliness are instilled, which, in many cases,
react on the mothers. The nurseries are usually under medical
supervision, and the small fees charged, which average in London
from 3d. to 4d. a day, and on the continent of Europe about 2d.,
are much less than the cost to the mother who places her young
children under the care of neighbours when at work or away from
home. Institutions of this kind were started in France in 1844,
and have been established in the majority of the large towns on
the continent of Europe. In the industrial centres of France and
Germany they have helped to check infantile mortality. The
state or municipality in nearly every case grants subsidies, but
few are maintained entirely by public authorities; voluntary
contributions are depended upon for the main support, and the
organization and management are left in the hands of private
societies and charitable institutions, although some outside
official supervision with regard to the number of infants
admitted to each institution, air-space, and ventilation and
general hygienic conditions is considered useful. In Great
Britain the establishment of such institutions has been left
almost entirely to private initiative; and in comparison with the
continent the provision is inadequate and unsatisfactory, Paris
having nearly double the proportion of accommodation for
infants to the population that is provided in London. The
National Society of Day Nurseries was founded in 1901 for the
purpose of providing a bureau where information may be found of
good methods of founding and managing a crèche.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÉCY<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (Cressy), a town of northern France, in the department
of Somme, on the Maye, 12 m. N. by E. of Abbeville by road.
It is famous in history for the great victory gained here on the
26th of August 1346 by the English under Edward III. over the
French of King Philip of Valois. After its campaign in northern
France, the English army retired into Ponthieu, and encamped
on the 25th of August at Crécy, the French king in the meantime
marching from Abbeville on Braye. Early on the 26th Edward&rsquo;s
army took up its position for battle, and Philip&rsquo;s, hearing of this,
moved to attack him, though the French army marched in much
disorder, and on arrival formed only an imperfect line of battle.
The English lay on the forward slope of a hillside, with their
right in front of the village of Crécy, their left resting on
Wadicourt. Two of the three divisions or &ldquo;battles&rdquo; were in first
line, that of the young prince of Wales (the Black Prince) on the
right, that of the earls of Northampton and Arundel on the left;
the third, under the king&rsquo;s own command, in reserve, and the
baggage was packed to the rear. Each battle consisted of a
centre of dismounted knights and men-at-arms, and two wings of
archers. The total force was 3900 men-at-arms, 11,000 English
archers, and 5000 Welsh light troops (Froissart, first edition, the
second gives a different estimate). The French were far stronger,
having at least 12,000 men-at-arms, 6000 mercenary crossbowmen
(Genoese), perhaps 20,000 of the <i>milice des communes</i>, besides a
certain number of foot of the feudal levy. Along with these
served a Luxemburg contingent of horse under John, king of
Bohemia, and other feudatories of the Holy Roman Empire, and
the whole force was probably about 60,000 strong.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter1"><img style="width:620px; height:470px" src="images/img389.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The day was far advanced when the French came upon the
English position. Philip, near Estrées, decided to halt and
bivouac, deferring the battle until the army was better closed up,
but the indiscipline of his army committed him to an immediate
action, and he ordered forward the Genoese crossbowmen, while a
line of men-at-arms deployed for battle behind them; the rest of
the army was still marching in an irregular column of route along
the road from Abbeville. A sudden thunderstorm caused a short
delay, then the archers and the crossbowmen opened the battle.
Here, for the first time in continental warfare, the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
long-bow proved its worth. After a brief contest the crossbowmen,
completely outmatched, were driven back with enormous
loss. Thereupon the first line of French knights behind them
charged down upon the &ldquo;faint-hearted rabble&rdquo; of their own
fugitives, and soon the first two lines of the French were a mere
mob of horse and foot struggling with each other. The archers
did not neglect the opportunity, and shot coolly and rapidly into
the helpless target in front of them. The second attack was
made by another large body of knights which had arrived, and
served but to increase the number of the casualties, though here
and there a few charged up to the English line and fell near it,
among them the blind king of Bohemia, who with a party of
devoted knights penetrated, and was killed amongst, the ranks of
the prince of Wales&rsquo;s men-at-arms. The battle was now one long
series of desperate but ill-conducted charges, a fresh onslaught
being made as each new corps of troops appeared on the scene.
The English archers on the flanks of the two first line battles had
been wheeled up, the centres of dismounted men-at-arms held
back, so that the whole line resembled a &ldquo;herse&rdquo; or harrow with
three points formed by the archers (see sketch). Each successive
body of the French sought to come to close quarters with the men-at-arms,
and exposed themselves therefore at short range to the
arrows on either flank. Under these circumstances there could
be but one issue of the battle. Though sixteen distinct attacks
were made, and the fighting lasted until long after dark, no
impression was made on the English line. At one moment the
prince was so far in danger that his barons sent to the king for
aid. Even then Edward was not disquieted and he sent a mere
handful of knights to the prince&rsquo;s battle, saying, &ldquo;Let the boy
win his spurs.&rdquo; The left battle of the English, hitherto somewhat
to the rear, moved up into line with the prince, and the French
attack slackened. By midnight the army of France was practically
annihilated; 1542 men of gentle blood were left dead on
the field and counted by Edward&rsquo;s heralds, the losses of the
remainder are unknown. Some fifty of the victors fell in the
battle. The story that the Black Prince adopted from the fallen
king of Bohemia the crest and motto now borne by the princes
of Wales lacks foundation (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">John, King of Bohemia</a></span>). A
memorial to the French and their allies was erected, by public
subscription in France, Luxemburg and Bohemia, in 1905.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREDENCE,<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Credence Table</span>, a small side-table, originally
an article of furniture placed near the high table in royal or noble
houses, at which the ceremony of the <i>praegustatio</i>, Italian
<i>credenziare</i>, the &ldquo;assay&rdquo; or tasting of food and drink for poisons
was performed by an official of the household, the <i>praegustator</i>
or <i>credentiarius</i> as he was called in Medieval Latin. Both the
ceremony and the table were known as <i>credentia</i> (Lat. <i>credere</i>, to
believe, trust), Ital. <i>credenza</i>, Fr. <i>crédence</i>. After the need for the
ceremony had disappeared the name still survived, and the table
developed a back and several shelves for the display of plate, and
gradually merged into the buffet (<i>q.v.</i>). It is, however, as an
article of ecclesiastical furniture that the credence table is most
familiar. It takes the form of a small table of wood or stone,
sometimes fixed and sometimes merely a shelf above or near the
piscina. It usually stands on the south or Epistle side of the
altar, and on it are placed, in the Roman Catholic Church, the
cruets containing the wine and water, the chalice, the candlesticks
to be carried by the acolytes, and other objects to be used in the
ceremony of the Mass. The use of such a table, to which earlier
the name of <i>paratorium</i> or <i>oblationarium</i> was given, appears to
have come into use when the personal presentation of the oblations
at the Mass became obsolete. When the pope celebrates
Mass a special credence table on the Gospel side of the altar is
used, and the ceremony of tasting for poison in the unconsecrated
elements is still observed. In some churches in England the old
credence tables still exist, as at the church of St Cross near
Winchester, where there is a fine stone 15th-century example;
more frequent are examples of the stone shelf near the piscina.
There are some carved wooden ones surviving, one type being
with a semicircular top and three legs placed in a triangle with a
lower shelf. The formal use of the credence table for the unconsecrated
elements and the holy vessels before the celebration
has been revived in the English Church.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREDENTIALS<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (<i>lettres de créance</i>), a document which
ambassadors, ministers plenipotentiary, and chargés d&rsquo;affaires
hand to the government to which they are accredited, for the
purpose, chiefly, of communicating to the latter the envoy&rsquo;s
diplomatic rank. It also contains a request that full credence be
accorded to his official statements. Until his credentials have
been presented and found in proper order, an envoy receives
no official recognition. The credentials of an ambassador or
minister plenipotentiary are signed by the chief of the state, those
of a chargé d&rsquo;affaires by the foreign minister.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREDI, LORENZO DI<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (1459-1537), Italian artist, whose
surname was Barducci, was born at Florence. He was the least
gifted of three artists who began life as journeymen with Andrea
del Verrocchio. Though he was the companion and friend of
Leonardo da Vinci and Perugino, and closely allied in style to
both, he had neither the genius of the one nor the facility of the
other. We admire in Da Vinci&rsquo;s heads a heavenly contentment
and smile, in his technical execution great gloss and smoothness of
finish. Credi&rsquo;s faces disclose a smiling beatitude; his pigments
have the polish of enamel. But Da Vinci imparted life to his
creations and modulation to his colours, and these are qualities
which hardly existed in Credi. Perugino displayed a well-known
form of tenderness in heads, moulded on the models of
the old Umbrian school. Peculiarities of movement and attitude
become stereotyped in his compositions; but when put on his
mettle, he could still exhibit power, passion, pathos. Credi often
repeated himself in Perugino&rsquo;s way; but being of a pious and
resigned spirit, he generally embodied in his pictures a feeling
which is yielding and gentle to the verge of coldness. Credi had a
respectable local practice at Florence. He was consulted on most
occasions when the opinion of his profession was required on
public grounds, <i>e.g.</i> in 1491 as to the fronting, and in 1498 as to
the lantern of the Florentine cathedral, in 1504 as to the place
due to Michelangelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;David.&rdquo; He never painted frescoes; at
rare intervals only he produced large ecclesiastical pictures. The
greater part of his time was spent on easel pieces, upon which he
expended minute and patient labour. But he worked with such
industry that numbers of his Madonnas exist in European
galleries. The best of his altar-pieces is that which represents the
Virgin and Child with Saints in the cathedral of Pistoia. A fine
example of his easel rounds is in the gallery of Mainz. Credi
rivalled Fra Bartolommeo in his attachment to Savonarola; but
he felt no inclination for the retirement of a monastery. Still, in
his old age, and after he had outlived the perils of the siege of
Florence (1527), he withdrew on an annuity into the hospital
of Santa Maria Nuova, where he died. The National Gallery,
London, has two pictures of the Virgin and Child by him.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREDIT<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> (Lat. <i>credere</i>, to believe), in a general sense, belief or
trust. The word is used also to express the repute which a person
has, or the estimation in which he is held. In a commercial sense
credit is the promise to pay at a future time for valuable consideration
in the present: hence, a reputation of solvency and
ability to make such payments is also termed credit. In bookkeeping
credit is the side of the account on which payments are
entered; hence, sometimes, the payments themselves.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The part which credit plays in the production and exchange of
wealth is discussed in all economic text-books, but special reference
may be made to K. Knies, <i>Geld und Kredit</i> (1873-1879), and H. D.
Macleod, <i>Theory of Credit</i> (1889-1891). See also Hartley Withers,
<i>The Meaning of Money</i> (1909).</p>
</div>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRÉDIT FONCIER,<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> in France, an institution for advancing
money on mortgage of real securities. Due to a great extent to
the initiative of the economist L. Wolowski, it was created by
virtue of a governmental decree of the 28th of February 1852.
This decree empowered the issue of loans at a low rate of interest,
secured by mortgage bonds, extending over a long period, and
repayable by annuities, including instalments of capital. On its
inception it had a capital of 25,000,000 francs and took the title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
of Banque Foncière de Paris. The parent institution in Paris
was followed by similar institutions in Nevers and Marseilles.
These two were afterwards amalgamated with the first under the
title of Crédit Foncier de France. The capital was increased
to 60,000,000 francs, the government giving a subvention of
10,000,000 francs, and exercising control over the bank by
directly appointing the governor and two deputy-governors. The
administration was vested in a council chosen by the shareholders,
but its decisions have no validity without the approval of the
governor. The Crédit Foncier has the right to issue bonds,
repayable in fifty or sixty years, and bearing a fixed rate of
interest. A certain number of the bonds carry prizes. The
loans must not exceed half the estimated value of the property
mortgaged, upon which the bank has the first mortgage. The
bank also makes advances to local bodies, departmental and
communal, for short or long periods, and with or without
mortgage. Its capital amounts to £13,500,000. Its charter was
renewed in 1881 for a period of ninety-nine years.</p>

<p>In 1860 the Crédit Foncier lent its support to the foundation of
an organization for supplying capital and credit for agricultural
and allied industries. This Crédit Agricole rendered but trifling
services to agriculture, however, and soon threw itself into
speculation. Between 1873 and 1876 it lent enormous sums to
the Egyptian government, obtaining the money by opening
credit with the Crédit Foncier and depositing with it the securities
of the Egyptian government. On the failure of the Egyptian
government to meet its payments the Crédit Agricole went into
liquidation, and the Crédit Foncier suffered severely in consequence.
The impracticability of the credit system to aid agriculture
as worked by the Crédit Agricole was very marked, and,
as a consequence, the financing of agricultural associations is
now entirely in the hands of the Banque de France.</p>

<p>The <i>Crédit Mobilier</i> is an institution for advancing loans on
personal or movable estate. It was constituted in 1871, on the
liquidation of the Société Générale de Crédit Mobilier, founded in
1852, which it absorbed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRÉDIT MOBILIER OF AMERICA,<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> a construction company
whose operations in connexion with the building of the Union
Pacific Railroad gave rise to the most serious political scandal in
the history of the United States Congress. The company was
originally chartered as the Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency in 1859.
In March 1864 a controlling interest in the stock was secured by
Thomas Durant, vice-president of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, and the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the
adoption of the name Crédit Mobilier of America. Durant
proposed to utilize it as a construction company, pay it an
extravagant sum for the work, and thus secure for the stockholders
of the Union Pacific, who now controlled the Crédit
Mobilier, the bonds loaned by the United States government.
The net proceeds from the government and the first mortgage
bonds issued to the construction company were $50,863,172.05,
slightly more than enough to pay the entire cost of construction.
According to the report of the Wilson Congressional Committee,
the Crédit Mobilier received in addition, in the form of stock,
income bonds, and land grant bonds, $23,000,000&mdash;a profit of
about 48%. The defenders of the company assert that several
items of expense were not included in this report, and that the
real net profit was considerably smaller, although they admit
that it was still unusually large. The work extended over the
years 1865-1867. During the winter of 1867-1868, when adverse
legislation by Congress was feared, it is alleged that Oakes Ames
(<i>q.v.</i>), a representative from Massachusetts and principal promoter
of the Crédit Mobilier, distributed a number of shares among
congressmen and senators to influence their attitude. Shares
were sold at par when a few dividends repaid a purchaser at this
price. Some in fact received dividends without any initial outlay
at all. As the result of a lawsuit between Ames and H. S.
McComb, some private letters were brought out in September
1872 which gave publicity to the entire proceedings. The House
appointed two investigating committees, the Poland and the
Wilson committees, and on the report of the former (1873) Ames
and James Brooks of New York were formally censured by the
House, the former for disposing of the stock and the latter for
improperly using his official position to secure part of it. Charges
were also made against Schuyler Colfax, then vice-president but
Speaker of the House at the time of the transaction, James A.
Garfield, William D. Kelley (1814-1880), John A. Logan, and
several other members either of the House or of the Senate. The
Senate later appointed a special committee to investigate the
charges against its members. This committee, on the 27th of
February 1873, recommended the expulsion from the Senate of
James W. Patterson, of New Hampshire; but as his term expired
within five days no action was taken. The evidence was exaggerated
by the Democrats for partisan purposes, but the investigation
showed clearly that many of those accused were at least
indiscreet if not dishonest. The company itself was merely a
type of the construction companies by which it was the custom
to build railways between 1860 and about 1880.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREDITON,<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> a market town in the South Molton parliamentary
division of Devonshire, England, 8 m. N.W. of Exeter
by the London &amp; South-Western railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 3974. It is situated in the narrow vale of the river
Creedy near its junction with the Exe, between two steep hills,
and is divided into two parts, the east or old town and the west
or new town. The church of Holy Cross, formerly collegiate, is
a noble Perpendicular building with Early English and other
early portions, and a fine central tower. The grammar school,
founded by Edward VI. and refounded by Elizabeth, has
exhibitions to Oxford and Cambridge universities. Shoe-making,
tanning, agricultural trade, tin-plating, and the manufacture
of confectionery and cider have superseded the former large
woollen and serge industries. In 1897 Crediton was made the
seat of a suffragan bishopric in the diocese of Exeter.</p>

<p>The first indication of settlement at Crediton (<i>Credington</i>,
<i>Cryditon</i>, <i>Kirton</i>) is the tradition that Winfrith or Boniface was
born there in 680. Perhaps in his memory (for the great extent
of the parish shows that it was thinly populated) it became in 909
the seat of the first bishopric in Devonshire. It was probably
only a village in 1049, when Leofric, bishop of Crediton, requested
Leo IX. to transfer the see to Exeter, as Crediton was &ldquo;an open
town and much exposed to the incursions of pirates.&rdquo; At the
Domesday Survey much of the land was still uncultivated, but
its prosperity increased, and in 1269 each of the twelve prebends
of the collegiate church had a house and farmland within the
parish. The bishops, to whom the manor belonged until the
Reformation, had difficulty in enforcing their warren and other
rights; in 1351 Bishop Grandison obtained an exemplification of
judgments of 1282 declaring that he had pleas of withernam,
view of frank pledge, the gallows and assize of bread and ale.
Two years later there was a serious riot against the increase of
copyhold. Perhaps it was at this time that the prescriptive
borough of Crediton arose. The jury of the borough are
mentioned in 1275, and Crediton returned two members to
parliament in 1306-1307, though never afterwards represented.
A borough seal dated 1469 is extant, but the corporation is not
mentioned in the grant made by Edward VI. of the church to
twelve principal inhabitants. The borough and manor were
granted by Elizabeth to William Killigrew in 1595, but there is no
indication of town organization then or in 1630, and in the 18th
century Crediton was governed by commissioners. In 1231 the
bishop obtained a fair, still held, on the vigil, feast and morrow
of St Lawrence. This was important as the wool trade was
established by 1249 and certainly continued until 1630, when the
market for kersies is mentioned in conjunction with a saying &ldquo;as
fine as Kirton spinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREDNER, CARL FRIEDRICH HEINRICH<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (1809-1876),
German geologist, was born at Waltershausen near Gotha, on
the 13th of March 1809. He investigated the geology of the
Thüringer Waldes, of which he published a map in 1846. He
was author of a work entitled <i>Über die Gliederung der oberen

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Carl Hermann Credner</span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), was born at
Gotha on the 1st of October 1841, educated at Breslau and
Göttingen, and took the degree of Ph.D. at Breslau in 1864. In
1870 he was appointed professor of geology in the university of
Leipzig, and in 1872 director of the Geological Survey of Saxony.
He is author of numerous publications on the geology of Saxony,

<p><span class="bold">CREECH, THOMAS<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (1659-1700), English classical scholar,
was born at Blandford, Dorsetshire, in 1659. He received his
early education from Thomas Curgenven, master of Sherborne
school. In 1675 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, and
obtained a fellowship in 1683 at All Souls&rsquo;. He was headmaster
of Sherborne school from 1694 to 1696, and in 1699 he received
a college living, but in June 1700 he hanged himself. The
immediate cause of the act was said to be a money difficulty,
though according to some it was a love disappointment; both
of these circumstances no doubt had their share in a catastrophe
primarily due to an already pronounced melancholia. Creech&rsquo;s
fame rests on his translation of Lucretius (1682) in rhymed
heroic couplets, in which, according to Otway, the pure ore of the
original &ldquo;somewhat seems refined.&rdquo; He also published a version
of Horace (1684), and translated the <i>Idylls of Theocritus</i> (1684),
the <i>Thirteenth Satire</i> of Juvenal (1693), the <i>Astronomicon</i> of
Manilius (1697), and parts of Plutarch, Virgil and Ovid.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREEDS<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (Lat. <i>credo</i>, I believe), or <span class="sc">Confessions of Faith</span>. We
are accustomed to regard the whole conception of creeds, <i>i.e.</i>
reasoned statements of religious belief, as inseparably connected
with the history of Christianity. But the new study of comparative
religion has something to teach us even here. The
saying <i>lex orandi lex credendi</i> is true of all times and of all peoples.
And since we must reckon praise as the highest form of prayer,
such an early Christian hymn as is found in 1 Tim. iii. 16 must be
acknowledged to be of the nature of a creed: &ldquo;He who was
manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up
in glory.&rdquo; It justifies the expansion of the second article of the
developed Christian creed from the standpoint of the earliest
Christian tradition. It also supplies a reason for including in our
survey of creeds some reference to pre-Christian hymns and
beliefs. The pendulum has swung back. Rather than despise
the faulty presentation of truth which we find in heathen religions
and their more or less degraded rites, we follow the apostle
Paul in his endeavour to trace in them attempts &ldquo;to feel after
God&rdquo; (Acts vii. 27). Augustine, the great teacher of the West,
was true to the spirit of the great Alexandrians, when he wrote
(<i>Ep.</i> 166): &ldquo;Let every good and true Christian understand that
truth, wherever he finds it, belongs to <i>his</i> Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are not concerned with the question whether the earliest
forms of recorded religious consciousness such as animism, or
totemism, or fetishism, were themselves degradations of a
primitive revelation or not.<a name="FnAnchor_1k" id="FnAnchor_1k" href="#Footnote_1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> We are only concerned with the
fact of experience that the human soul yearns to express its
belief. The hymn to the rising and setting sun in the <i>Book of the
Dead</i> (ch. 15), which is said by Egyptologists to be the oldest
poem in the world, carries us back at once to the dawn of
history.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, Ra, the self-existent.... Glorious is</p>
<p class="i05">thine uprising from the horizon. Both worlds are</p>
<p class="i05">illumined by thy rays.... Hail to thee, Ra, when thou</p>
<p class="i05">returnest home in renewed beauty, crowned and almighty.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>In a later hymn Amen-Ra is confessed as &ldquo;the good god
beloved, maker of men, creator of beasts, maker of things below
and above, lord of mercy most loving.&rdquo; A similar note is struck
in the Indian Vedas. In the more ethical religion of the Avesta
the creator is more clearly distinguished from the creature: &ldquo;I
desire to approach Ahura and Mithra with my praise, the lofty
eternal, and the holy two.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2k" id="FnAnchor_2k" href="#Footnote_2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The Persian poet is not far from
the kingdom into which Hebrew psalmists and prophets entered.</p>

<p>The whole history of the Jewish religion is centred in the
gradual purification of the idea of God. The morality of the Jews
did not outgrow their religion, but their interest was always
ethical and not speculative. The highest strains of the psalmists
and the most fervent appeals of the prophets were progressively
directed to the great end of praising and preaching the One true
God, everlasting, with sincere and pure devotion. The creed of
the Jew, to this day, is summed up in the well-remembered words,
which have been ever on his lips, living or dying: &ldquo;Hear, O
Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord&rdquo; (Deut. vi. 4).</p>

<p>The definiteness and persistence of this creed, which of course
is the strength also of Mahommedanism, presents a contrast to
the fluid character of the statements in the Vedas, and to the
chaos of conflicting opinions of philosophers among the Greeks
and Romans. As Dr J. R. Illingworth has said very concisely:
&ldquo;The physical speculations of the Ionians and Atomists rendered
a God superfluous, and the metaphysical and logical reasoning of
the Eleatics declared Him to be unknowable.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_3k" id="FnAnchor_3k" href="#Footnote_3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Plato regarding
the world as an embodiment of eternal, archetypal ideas, which he
groups under the central idea of Good, identified with the divine
reason, at the same time uses the ordinary language of the day,
and speaks of God and the gods, feeling his way towards the
conception of a personal God, which, to quote Dr Illingworth
again, neither he nor Aristotle could reach because they had not
&ldquo;a clear conception of human personality.&rdquo; They were followed
by an age of philosophizing which did little to advance speculation.
The Stoics, for example, were more successful in criticizing
the current creed than in explaining the underlying truth which
they recognized in polytheism. The final goal of Greek philosophy
was only reached when the great thinkers of the early Christian
Church, who had been trained in the schools of Alexandria and
Athens, used its modes of thought in their analysis of the Christian
idea of God. &ldquo;In this sense the doctrine of the Trinity was the
synthesis, and summary, of all that was highest in the Hebrew
and Hellenic conceptions of God, fused into union by the electric
touch of the Incarnation.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4k" id="FnAnchor_4k" href="#Footnote_4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>Space does not permit enlargement on this theme, but enough
has been said to introduce the direct study of the ancient creeds
of Christendom.</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">The Ancient Creeds of Christendom.</span>&mdash;The three creeds
which may be called oecumenical, although the measure of
their acceptance by the universal church has not been uniform,
represent three distinct types provided for the use of the catechumen,
the communicant, and the church teacher respectively.
The Apostles&rsquo; Creed is the ancient baptismal creed, held in
common both by East and West, in its final western form.
The Nicene Creed is the baptismal creed of an eastern church
enlarged in order to combine theological interpretation with
the facts of the historic faith. Its use in the Eucharist of the
undivided Church has been continued since the great schism,
although the Eastern Church protests against the interpolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
of the words &ldquo;And the Son&rdquo; in clause 9. The Athanasian Creed
is an instruction designed to confute heresies which were current
in the 5th century.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Apostles&rsquo; Creed.</i>&mdash;The increased interest which has been
shown in the history of all creed-forms since the latter part of the
19th century is due in a great measure to the work of
the veteran pioneer, Professor P. Caspari of Christiania,
<span class="sidenote">Apostles&rsquo; Creed.</span>
who began the herculean task of classifying the
enormous number of creed-forms which have been recovered
from obscure pages of early Christian literature. In England
we owe much to Professors C. A. Heurtley and Swainson. In
Germany the monumental work of Professor Kattenbusch has
overshadowed all other books on the subject, providing even his
most ardent critics with an indispensable record of the literature
of the subject.</p>

<p>The majority of critics agree that the only trace of a formal
creed in the New Testament is the simple confession of Jesus as
the Lord, <i>or</i> the Son of God (Rom. x. 9; 1 Cor. xii. 3). While the
apostles were agreed on an outline of teaching (Rom. vi. 17)
which included the doctrine of God, the person and work of
Christ, and the person and work of the Holy Spirit, it does not
appear that they provided any summary, which would cover
this ground, as an authoritative statement of their belief. The
tradition which St Paul received included, so to speak, the
germ of the central prayer in the Eucharist (1 Cor. xi. 23 ff.), and
no doubt included also teaching on conduct, &ldquo;the way of a
Christian life&rdquo; (1 Thess. iv. 1; Gal. v. 21). The creed in all its
forms lies behind worship, which it preserves from idolatry, and
behind ethics, to which it supplies a motive power which the
pre-Christian system so manifestly lacked. Whether the first
creed of the primitive Church was of the simple Christological
character which confession of Jesus as the Lord expresses, or of
an enlarged type based on the baptismal formula (Matt. xxviii.
19), makes no difference to the statement that the faith which
overcame the world derived its energy from convictions which
strove for utterance. &ldquo;With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation&rdquo; (Rom. x. 10).</p>

<p>When St Paul reminds Timothy (1 Tim. vi. 13) of his confession
before many witnesses he does not seem to imply more than
confession of Christ as king. He calls it &ldquo;the beautiful confession&rdquo;
to which Christ Jesus had borne witness before Pontius
Pilate, and charges Timothy before God, who quickeneth all
things, to keep this commandment. Some writers, notably
Professor Zahn,<a name="FnAnchor_5k" id="FnAnchor_5k" href="#Footnote_5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a> piecing together this text with 2 Tim. i. 13, ii. 8,
iv. 1, 2, reconstructs a primitive Apostles&rsquo; Creed of Antioch, the
city from which St Paul started on his missionary journeys. But
there is no mention of a third article in the creed, beyond a
reference to the Holy Ghost in the context of 2 Tim. i. 14, which
would prove the apostolic use of a Trinitarian confession imaginable
as the parent of the later Eastern and Western forms. The
eunuch&rsquo;s creed interpolated in Acts viii. 57, &ldquo;I believe that
Jesus is the Son of God,&rdquo; since the reading was known to
Irenaeus, probably represents the form of baptismal confession
used in some church of Asia Minor, and supplies us with the type
of a primitive creed. This theory is confirmed by the evidence
of the Johannine epistles (1 John iv. 15, v. 5; cf. Heb. iv. 14).</p>

<p>From this point of view it is easy to explain the occurrence of
creed-like phrases in the New Testament as fragments of early
hymns (1 Tim. iii. 16) or reminiscences of oral teaching (1 Cor. xv.
1 ff.). The following form which Seeberg gives as the creed of St
Paul is an artificial combination of fragments of oral teaching,
which naturally reappear in the teaching of St Peter, but finds no
attestation in the later creeds of particular churches which
would prove its claim to be their parent form:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The living God who created all things sent His Son Jesus Christ,
born of the seed of David, who died for our sins according to the
scriptures, and was buried, who was raised on the third day according
to the scriptures, and appeared to Cephas and the XII., who sat at the
right hand of God in the heavens, all rule and authority and power
being made subject unto Him, and is coming on the clouds of heaven
with power and great glory.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The evidence of the apostolic fathers is disappointing. Clement
(<i>Cor.</i> lviii. 2) supplies only parallels to the baptismal formula
(Matt. xxviii. 19). Polycarp (<i>Ep.</i> 7) echoes St John. But
Ignatius might seem to offer in the following passage some
confirmation of Zahn&rsquo;s theory of a primitive creed of Antioch
(<i>Trall.</i> 9): &ldquo;Be ye deaf, therefore, when any man speaketh to you
apart from Jesus Christ, who was of the race of David, who was
the Son of Mary, who was truly born and ate and drank, was
truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate, was truly crucified and
died in the sight of those in heaven and those on earth and those
under the earth; who, moreover, was truly raised from the dead,
His Father having raised Him, who in the like fashion will so
raise us also who believe on Him&mdash;His Father, I say, will raise us&mdash;in
Christ Jesus, apart from whom we have not true life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The differences, however, which divide this from the later
creed forms are scarcely less noticeable than their agreement,
and the evidence of the Ignatian epistles generally (<i>Eph</i>. xviii.;
<i>Smyrn.</i> i.), while it confirms the conclusion that instruction was
given in Antioch on all points characteristic of the developed
creed, <i>e.g.</i> the Miraculous Birth, Crucifixion, Resurrection, the
Catholic Church, forgiveness of sins, the hope of resurrection,
does not prove that this teaching was as yet combined in a
Trinitarian form which classified the latter clauses under the
work of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>At this point a word must be said on the important question of
interpretation. While we may hope for eventual agreement on
the history of the different types of creed forms, there can be no
hope of agreement on the interpretation of the words Holy Spirit
between Unitarian and Trinitarian critics. Writers who follow
Harnack explain &ldquo;holy spirit&rdquo; as the gift of impersonal influence,
and between wide limits of difference agree in regarding Christ as
Son of God by adoption and not by nature. Amid the chaos of
conflicting opinions as to the original teaching of Jesus, the
Gospel within the Gospel, the central question &ldquo;What think ye
of Christ?&rdquo; emerges as the test of all theories. &ldquo;No man can
say that Jesus is the Lord save in the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (1 Cor. xii. 3).
Belief in the fact of the Incarnation of the eternal Word, as it is
stated in the words of Ignatius quoted above, or in any of the
later creeds, stands or falls with belief in the Holy Ghost as the
guide alike of their convictions and destinies, no mere impersonal
influence, but a living voice.</p>

<p>If the essence of Christianity is winnowed down to a bare
imitation of the Man Jesus, and his religion is accepted as
Buddhists accept the religion of Buddha, still it cannot be
denied that the early Christians put their trust in Christ rather
than his religion. &ldquo;I am the life,&rdquo; not &ldquo;I teach the life,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
the truth,&rdquo; not merely &ldquo;I teach the truth,&rdquo; are not additions of
Johannine theology but the central aspect of the presentation of
Christ as the good physician, healer of souls and bodies, which the
most rigid scrutiny of the Synoptic Gospels leaves as the residuum
of accepted fact about Jesus of Nazareth. To say more would be
out of place in this article, but enough has been said to introduce
the exhaustive discussion by Kattenbusch (ii. 471-728) of the
meaning of the theological teaching both of the New Testament
and of the earliest creeds.</p>

<p>To return within our proper limits. Kattenbusch, with whom
Harnack is in general agreement, regards the Old Roman Creed,
which comes to light in the 4th century, as the parent of all
developed forms, whether Eastern or Western. Marcellus, the
exiled bishop of Ancyra, is quoted by Epiphanius as presenting
it to Bishop Julius of Rome c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 340. Ussher&rsquo;s recognition of
the fact that this profession of faith by Marcellus was the creed of
Rome, not of Ancyra, is the starting-point of modern discussions
of the history of the creeds. Some sixty years later Rufinus, a
priest of Aquileia, wrote a commentary on the creed of his native
city and compared it with the Roman Creed. His Latin text is
probably as ancient as the Greek text of Marcellus, because the
Roman Church must always have been bilingual in its early days.
It was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span></p>

<tr><td class="tcr">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">12. (the) resurrection of the flesh.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This Old Roman Creed may be traced back in the writings of
Bishops Felix and Dionysus (3rd century), and in the writings of
Tertullian in the 2nd century.</p>

<p>Tertullian calls the creed the &ldquo;token&rdquo; which the African
Church shares with the Roman (<i>de Praescr.</i> 36): &ldquo;The Roman
Church has made a common token with the African Churches, has
recognized one God, creator of the universe, and Christ Jesus, of
the Virgin Mary, Son of God the Creator, and the resurrection of
the flesh.&rdquo; The reference is to the earthenware token which two
friends broke in order that they might commend a stranger for
hospitality by sending with him the broken half. Their creed
became the passport by which Christians in strange cities could
obtain admission to assemblies for worship and to common meals.
The passage quoted is obviously a condensed quotation of the
Roman Creed, which reappears also in the following (<i>de Virg.
vel.</i> i.):</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The rule of faith is one altogether ... of believing in one God
Almighty, maker of the world, and in His Son Jesus Christ, born of
Mary the Virgin, crucified under Pontius Pilate; the third day
raised from the dead, received in the heavens, sitting now at the
right hand of the Father, about to come and judge quick and dead
through the resurrection also of the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There are many references in Tertullian to the teaching of the
Gnostic Marcion, whose breach with the Roman Church may be
dated <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 145. He seems to have still held to the Roman
creed interpreted in his own way. An ingenious conjecture by
Zahn enables us to add the words &ldquo;holy Church&rdquo; to our reconstruction
of the creed from the writings of Tertullian. In his
revised New Testament Marcion speaks of &ldquo;the covenant which
is the mother of us all, which begets us in the holy Church, to
which we have vowed allegiance.&rdquo; He uses a word used by
Ignatius of the oath taken on confession of the Christian faith.
It follows that the words &ldquo;holy Church&rdquo; were contained in the
Roman Creed.<a name="FnAnchor_6k" id="FnAnchor_6k" href="#Footnote_6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>While all critics agree in tracing back this form to the earliest
years of the 2nd century, and regard it as the archetype of all
similar Western creeds, there is great diversity of opinion on its
relation to Eastern forms. Kattenbusch maintains that the
Roman Creed reached Gaul and Africa in the course of the 2nd
century, and perhaps all districts of the West that possessed
Christian congregations, also the western end of Asia Minor
possibly in connexion with Polycarp&rsquo;s visit to Rome <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 154.
He finds that materials fail for Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Syria, Palestine, Egypt. Further, he holds that all the Eastern
creeds which are known to us as existing in the 4th century, or
may be traced back to the 3rd, lead to Antioch as their starting-point.
He concludes that the Roman Creed was accepted at
Antioch after the fall of Paul of Samosata in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 272, and was
adapted to the dogmatic requirements of the time, all the later
creeds of Palestine, Asia Minor and Egypt being dependent on it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kunze, Loofs, Sanday, and Zahn find
evidence of the existence of an Eastern type of creed of equal
or greater antiquity and distinguished from the Roman by such
phrases as &ldquo;One&rdquo; (God), &ldquo;Maker of heaven and earth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;suffered,&rdquo; &ldquo;shall come again in glory.&rdquo; Thus Kunze reconstructs
a creed of Antioch for the 3rd century, and argues that it
is independent of the Roman Creed.</p>

<p class="noind">Sanday (<i>Journal Theol. Studies</i>, iii. 1) does not attempt a reconstruction
on this elaborate scale, but contents himself with
pointing out evidence, which Kattenbusch seems to him to have
missed, for the existence of creeds of Egypt, Cappadocia and
Palestine before the time of Aurelian. He criticizes Harnack&rsquo;s
theory that there existed in the East, that is, in Asia Minor, or in
Asia Minor and Syria as far back as the beginning of the 2nd
century, a Christological instruction (<span class="grk" title="mathêma">&#956;&#940;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>) organically related
to the second article of the Roman Creed, and formulas which
taught that the &ldquo;One God&rdquo; was &ldquo;Creator of heaven and earth,&rdquo;
and referred to the holy prophetic spirit, and lasted on till they
influenced the course of creed-development in the 4th century.
He asks, is it not simpler to believe that there was a definite type
in the background?</p>

<p>Another English student, the Rev. T. Barns, engaged specially
in work upon the history of the creed of Cappadocia, points out
the importance of the extraordinary influence of Firmilian of
Caesarea in the affairs of the church of Antioch in the early part
of the 3rd century. He is led to argue that the creed of Antioch
came rather from Cappadocia than Rome. Whether his conclusion
is justified or not, it helps to show how strongly the trend
of contemporary research is setting against the theory of Kattenbusch
that the Roman Creed when adopted at Antioch became
the parent of all Eastern forms. It does not, however, militate
against the possibility that the Roman Creed was carried from
Rome to Asia Minor and to Palestine in the 2nd century. It is
evidently impossible to arrive at a final decision until much more
spade work has been done in the investigation of early Eastern
creeds. Connolly&rsquo;s study of the early Syrian creed (<i>Zeitschrift
für die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft</i>, 1906, p. 202) deserves
careful consideration. His reconstruction of the creed of
Aphraates is interesting in relation to the other traces of a
Syriac creed form existing prior to the 4th century.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>[I believe] in God the Lord of all, that made the heavens and the
earth and the seas and all that in them is; [And in our Lord Jesus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>

[and] in the mystery of Baptism (of the remission of sins).</p>
</div>

<p>The probable battle-ground of the future between the opposing
theories lies in the writings of Irenaeus. He has most of
the characteristic expressions of the Eastern creeds. He inserts
&ldquo;one&rdquo; in clause 1 and 2. He has the phrases &ldquo;Maker of heaven
and earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;suffered,&rdquo; and &ldquo;crucified,&rdquo; with &ldquo;under Pontius
Pilate&rdquo; after instead of before it. Probably also he had &ldquo;in
glory&rdquo; in clause 8. But there is always the possibility to be faced
that Irenaeus drew his creed from Rome rather than Asia Minor.
Kattenbusch does not shrink from suggesting that he shows
acquaintance with the Roman Creed, and that Justin Martyr
also knew it, in which case all the so-called Eastern characteristics
have been imprinted on the original Roman form, and are not
derived from an Eastern archetype. But the ordinary reader need
not feel concern about the future victory of either theory. The
plain fact is that the same facts were taught in Palestine, Asia
Minor and Gaul, whether gathered up in a parallel creed form
or not. The contrast which Rufinus draws between the Roman
Creed and others, both of the East and the West, is justified.
In comparison with them it was guarded more carefully from
change.<a name="FnAnchor_7k" id="FnAnchor_7k" href="#Footnote_7k"><span class="sp">7</span></a> We have yet to inquire how it received the additions
which distinguish the derived form now in use as the baptismal
creed of all Western Christendom. Some had already found an
entrance into Western creeds. We find &ldquo;suffered&rdquo; in the creed
of Milan, &ldquo;descended into hell&rdquo; in the creed of Aquileia, the
Danubian lands and Syria; the words &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;almighty&rdquo;
were shortly added to clause 7 in the Spanish creed; &ldquo;life
everlasting&rdquo; had stood from an early date in the African creed.
The creed of Caesarius of Arles (d. 543) proves that these variations
had all been united in one Gallican creed together with
&ldquo;catholic&rdquo; and &ldquo;communion of saints,&rdquo; but this Gallican form
still lacked &ldquo;Maker of heaven and earth&rdquo; and the additions in
clause 7.</p>

<p>Two newly-discovered creeds help us greatly to narrow down
the limits of the problem. The creed of Niceta of Remesiana in
Dacia proves that c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400 the Dacian church had added to the
Roman Creed &ldquo;maker of heaven and earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;suffered,&rdquo; &ldquo;dead,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Catholic,&rdquo; &ldquo;communion of saints&rdquo; and &ldquo;life everlasting.&rdquo;
Parallel to it is the Faith of St Jerome discovered in 1903 by
Dom. Morin.<a name="FnAnchor_8k" id="FnAnchor_8k" href="#Footnote_8k"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center pt2"><i>The Faith of St Jerome</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in one God the Father almighty, maker of things
visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, born of God, God of God, Light of Light, almighty of
almighty, true God of true God, born before the ages, not made,
by whom all things were made in heaven and in earth. Who
for our salvation descended from heaven, was conceived of the
Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered by suffering under
Pontius Pilate, under Herod the King, crucified, buried, descended
into hell, trod down the sting of death, rose again the third day,
appeared to the apostles. After this He ascended into heaven,
sitteth at the right of God the Father, thence shall come to judge
the quick and the dead. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, God not
unbegotten nor begotten, not created nor made, but
co-eternal with
the Father and the Son. I believe (that there is) remission of sins
in the holy catholic church, communion of saints, resurrection of
the flesh unto eternal life. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">This creed may be the form which Jerome mentions in one of his
letters (<i>Ep.</i> 17, n. 4) as sent to Cyril of Jerusalem. It is important
as connecting the creeds of East and West. Since Jerome was
born in Pannonia we may conjecture that he is inserting Nicene
phrases from the Jerusalem creed into his baptismal creed, and
that this form added to Niceta&rsquo;s creed proves that the creed of
the Danube lands possessed the clauses &ldquo;maker of heaven and
earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;communion of saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first occurrence of the completed form is in a treatise
(<i>Scarapsus</i>) of the Benedictine missionary Pirminius, abbot of
Reichenau (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 730). The difficulty hitherto has been to
trace the source from which the clause &ldquo;maker of heaven and
earth&rdquo; has come into it. It has been known that the forms in use
in the south of France approximated to it but without those
words. In the 6th century we find creed forms in use in Gaul
which include them, but include also other variations distinguishing
them from the form which we seek. The missing link which
has hitherto been lacking in the evidence has been found by
Barns in the influence of Celtic missionaries who streamed
across from Europe until they came in touch with the remnants
of the Old Latin Christianity of the Danube. The chief documents
of the date <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700, which contain forms almost identical with
the received text, are connected with monasteries founded by
Columban and his friends: Bobbio, Luxeuil, S. Gallen, Reichenau.
From one of these monasteries the received text seems to have
been taken to Rome. Certainly it was from Rome that it was
spread. We can trace the use of the received text along the line
of the journeys both of Pirminius and Boniface, and there is
little doubt that they received it from the Roman Church, with
which Boniface was in frequent communication. Pope Gregory
II. sent him instructions to use what seems to have been an
official Roman order of Baptism, which would doubtless include a
Roman form of creed. Pirminius, who was far from being an
original writer, made great use of a treatise by Martin of Braga,
but substituted a Roman form of Renunciation, and refers to the
Roman rite of Unction in a way which leads us to suppose that the
form of creed which he substituted for Martin&rsquo;s form was also
Roman. It seems clear, therefore, that the received text was
either made or accepted in Rome, c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700, and disseminated
through the Benedictine missionaries. At the end of the 8th
century Charlemagne inquired of the bishops of his empire as to
current forms. The reply of Amalarius of Trier is important
because it shows that he not only used the received text, but also
connected it with the Roman order of Baptism. The emperor&rsquo;s
wish for uniformity doubtless led in a measure to its eventual
triumph over all other forms.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Nicene Creed</i> of the liturgies, often called the Constantinopolitan
creed, is the old baptismal creed of Jerusalem revised
by the insertion of Nicene terms. The idea that the
council merely added to the last section has been
<span class="sidenote">Nicene Creed.</span>
disproved by Hort&rsquo;s famous dissertation in 1876.<a name="FnAnchor_9k" id="FnAnchor_9k" href="#Footnote_9k"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
The text of the creed of the Nicene Council was based on the
creed of Eusebius of Caesarea, and a comparison of the four
creeds side by side proves to demonstration their distinctness, in
spite of the tendency of copyists to confuse and assimilate the
forms.<a name="FnAnchor_10k" id="FnAnchor_10k" href="#Footnote_10k"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p class="noind">The revised Jerusalem Creed was quoted by Epiphanius in his
treatise <i>The Anchored One</i>, c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 374, some years before the
council of Constantinople (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 381). We gather that it had
already been introduced into Cyprus as a baptismal creed. Hort&rsquo;s
identification of it as the work of Cyril of Jerusalem is now
generally accepted. On his return from exile in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 362 Cyril
would find &ldquo;a natural occasion for the revision of the public
creed by the skilful insertion of some of the conciliar language,
including the term which proclaimed the restoration of full
communion with the champions of Nicaea, and other phrases and
clauses adapted for impressing on the people positive truth.&rdquo;
Some of Cyril&rsquo;s personal preferences expressed in his catechetical
lectures find expression, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;resurrection of the <i>dead</i>&rdquo; for
&ldquo;flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weak point in Hort&rsquo;s theory was the suggestion that the
creed was brought before the council by Cyril in self justification.
The election of Meletius of Antioch as the first president of the
council carried with it the vindication of his old ally Cyril.
Kunze&rsquo;s suggestion is far more probable that it was used at the
baptism of Nektarius, praetor of the city, who was elected third
president of the council while yet unbaptized. Unfortunately
the acts of the council have been lost, but they were quoted at
the council of Chalcedon in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 451, and the revised Jerusalem
Creed was quoted as &ldquo;the faith of the 150 Fathers,&rdquo; that is, as
confirmed in some way by the council of Constantinople, while at
the time it was distinguished from &ldquo;the faith of the 318 Fathers&rdquo;
of Nicaea. One of the signatories of the Definition of Faith made
at Chalcedon, in which both creeds were quoted in full,
Kalemikus, bishop of Apamea in Bithynia, refers to the council of
Constantinople as having been held at the ordination of the most
pious Nektarius the bishop. Obviously there was some connexion
in his mind between the creed and the ordination.</p>

<p>The reasons which brought the revised creed into prominence
at Chalcedon are still obscure. It is possible that Leo&rsquo;s letter
to Flavian gave the impulse to put it forward because it contained
a parallel to words which Leo quoted from the Old Roman Creed,
&ldquo;born of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary,&rdquo; &ldquo;crucified and
buried,&rdquo; which do not occur in the first Nicene Creed. If, as
is probable, it was from the election of Nektarius the baptismal
creed of Constantinople, we may even ask whether the pope did
not refer to it when he wrote emphatically of the &ldquo;common and
indistinguishable confession&rdquo; of all the faithful. Kattenbusch
supposes that Anatolius, bishop of Constantinople, or his archdeacon
Aetius, who read the creed at the 2nd session of the
council, took up the idea that through its likeness to the Roman
Creed it would be a useful weapon against Eutyches and others
who were held to interpret the Nicene Creed in an Apollinarian
sense. But Kunze thinks that it was not used as a base of operations
against Eutyches because there is some evidence that
Monophysites were willing to accept it. Certainly it won its
way to general acceptance in the East as the creed of the church
of the imperial city; regarded as an improved recension of the
Nicene Faith. The history of the introduction of the creed into
liturgies is still obscure. Peter Fullo, bishop of Antioch, was the
first to use it in the East, and in the West a council held by King
Reccared at Toledo in 589. The theory of Probst that it had been
used in Rome before this time has not been confirmed. King
Reccared&rsquo;s council is usually credited with the introduction of
the words &ldquo;And the Son&rdquo; into clause 9 of the creed. But some
MSS.<a name="FnAnchor_11k" id="FnAnchor_11k" href="#Footnote_11k"><span class="sp">11</span></a> omit them in the creed-text while inserting them in a canon
of the faith drawn up at the time. Probably they were interpolated
in the creed by mistake of copyists. When attention
was called to the interpolation in the 9th century it became one
cause of the schism between East and West. Charlemagne was
unable to persuade Pope Leo III. to alter the text used in Rome
by including the words. But it was so altered by the pope&rsquo;s
successor.</p>

<p>The interpolation really witnessed to a deep-lying difference
between Eastern and Western theology. Eastern theologians
expressed the mysterious relationship of the Holy Spirit to the
Father and the Son in such phrases as &ldquo;Who proceedeth from
the Father and receiveth from the Son,&rdquo; rightly making the
Godhead of the Father the foundation and primary source of
the eternally derived Godhead of the Son and the Spirit. Western
theologians approached the problem from another point of view.
Hilary, starting from the thought of Divine self-consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
as the explanation of the coinherence of the Father in the Son
and the Son in the Father, says that the Spirit receives of both.
Augustine teaches that the Father and the Son are the one
principle of the Being of the Spirit. From this it is a short step
to say with the <i>Quicumque vult</i> that the Spirit proceeds from the
Son, while guarding the idea that the Father is the one fountain of
Deity. Since Eastern theologians would be willing to say &ldquo;proceeds
from the Father through the Son,&rdquo; it is clear that the two
views are not irreconcilable.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Athanasian Creed</i>, so called because in many MSS.
it bears the title &ldquo;The Faith of S. Athanasius,&rdquo; is more accurately
designated by its first words <i>Quicumque vult</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_12k" id="FnAnchor_12k" href="#Footnote_12k"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Its
history has been the subject of much controversy for
<span class="sidenote">Athanasian Creed.</span>
years past, but no longer presents an insoluble problem.
Critics indeed agree on the main outline. Until 1870
the standard work on the subject was Waterland&rsquo;s <i>Critical
History of the Athanasian Creed</i>, first published in 1723. Having
traced &ldquo;the opinions of the learned moderns&rdquo; from Gerard
Vossius, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1642, &ldquo;who led the way to a more strict and critical
inquiry,&rdquo; Waterland passed in review all the known MSS. and
commentaries, and after a searching investigation concluded that
the creed was written in Gaul between 420 and 430, probably
by Hilary of Arles.</p>

<p>In 1870 the controversy on the use of the creed in the Book of
Common Prayer led to fresh investigation of the MSS., and a
theory known as the &ldquo;Two-portion theory&rdquo; was started by
C. A. Swainson, developed by J. R. Lumby, and adopted by
Harnack. Swainson thought that the <i>Quicumque</i> was brought
into its present shape in the 9th century. The so-called profession
of Denebert, bishop-elect of Worcester, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 798 presented to
the archbishop of Canterbury (which includes clauses 1, 3-6,
20-22, 24, 25), and the Trèves fragment (a portion of a sermon
in <i>Paris bibl. nat. Lat.</i> 3836, <i>saec.</i> viii., which quoted clauses
27-34, 36-40), seemed to him to represent the component parts
of the creed as they existed separately. He conjectured that they
were brought together in the province of Rheims c. 860.</p>

<p>This theory, however, depended upon unverified assumptions,
such as the supposed silence of theologians about the creed at
the beginning of the 9th century; the suggestion that the
completed creed would have been useful to them if they had
known it as a weapon against the heresy of Adoptianism;
the assertion that no MS. containing the complete text was of
earlier date than c. 813. This was Lumby&rsquo;s revised date, but
the progress of palaeographical studies has made it possible
to demonstrate that MSS. of the 8th century do exist which
contain the complete creed.</p>

<p>The two-portion theory was vigorously attacked by G. D. W.
Ommanney, who was successful in the discovery of new documents,
notably early commentaries, which contained the text
of the creed embedded in them, and thus supplied independent
testimony to the fact that the creed was becoming fairly widely
known at the end of the 8th century. Other new MSS. and
commentaries were found and collated by the Rev. A. E. Burn
and Dom Morin. In 1897 Loofs, summing up the researches of
25 years in his article <i>Athanasianum</i> (<i>Realencyclopädie f. prot.
Theol. u. Kirche</i>, 3rd ed. ii. p. 177), declared that the two-portion
theory was dead.</p>

<p>This conclusion has never been seriously challenged. It has
been greatly strengthened by the discovery of a MS. which was
presented by Bishop Leidrad of Lyons with an autograph inscription
to the altar of St Stephen in that town, some time before
814. As M. Delisle at once pointed out (<i>Notices et extraits des
manuscrits</i>, 1898), this MS. supplies a fixed date from which
palaeographers can work in dating MSS. The <i>Quicumque</i> occurs
in a collection of materials forming an introduction to the psalter.
The suggestion has been made that Leidrad intended to use the
<i>Quicumque</i> in his campaign against the Adoptianists in 798.
But the phrases of the creed seem to have needed sharpening
against the Nestorian tendency of the Adoptianists. It is more
probable that Leidrad was interested in the growing use of the
creed as a canticle, and was consulted in the preparation of the
famous Golden Psalter, now at Vienna, which contains the same
collection of documents as an introduction. This MS. may now
without hesitation be assigned to the date 772-788. The earliest
known MS. is at Milan (<i>Cod. Ambros.</i> O, 212, <i>sup.</i>), and is dated
by Traube as early as c. 700.</p>

<p>There is a reference to the <i>Quicumque</i> in the first canon of the
fourth council of Toledo of the year 633, which quotes part or
the whole of clauses 4, 20-22, 28 f., 31, 33, 35 f., 40. The council
also quoted phrases from the so-called <i>Creed of Damasus</i>, a document
of the 4th century, which in some cases they preferred to
the phrases of the <i>Quicumque</i>. Their quotations form a connecting
link in the chain of evidence by which the use of the creed
may be traced back to the writings of Caesarius, bishop of Arles
(503-543). Dom Morin has now demonstrated (&ldquo;Le Symbole
d&rsquo;Athanase et son premier témoin S. Césaire d&rsquo;Arles,&rdquo; <i>Rev.
Bénédictine</i>, Oct. 1901) that Caesarius used the creed continually
as a sort of elementary catechism. The fact that it exactly
reproduces both the qualities and the literary defects of Caesarius
is a strong argument in favour of Morin&rsquo;s suggestion that he may
have been the author. Further, Caesarius was in the habit of
putting some words of a distinguished writer at the head of his
compositions, which would account for the fact that the name
of Athanasius was subsequently attached to the creed.</p>

<p>The use, however, of the <i>Quicumque</i> by Caesarius as a catechism
may be explained by the suggestion that it had been taught him
in his youth, so that his style had been moulded by it. He was
not an original thinker. Moreover, the creed is quoted by his
rival Avitus, bishop of Vienne 490-523, who quotes clause 22,
as from the Rule of Catholic Faith, but was not likely to value
a composition of Caesarius so highly. Morin does not deal fully
with the arguments from internal evidence which point back
to the beginning of the 5th century as the date of the creed. If
the creed-phrases needed sharpening against the revived
Nestorian error of the Adoptianists, it is scarcely likely to have
been written during the generation following the condemnation
of Nestorius in 431. Burn suggests that it was written to meet
the Sabellian and Apollinarian errors of the Spanish heretic
Priscillian, possibly by Honoratus, bishop of Arles (d. 429).
He suggests further that the <i>Creed of Damasus</i> was the reply
of that pope to Priscillian&rsquo;s appeal. This would explain the
quotation of the two documents together by the council of Toledo,
since the heresy lasted on for a long time in Spain. But the
theory has been carried to extravagant lengths by Künstle, who
thinks that the creed was written in Spain in the 5th century,
and soon taken to the monastery of Lerins. There are phrases in
the writings of Vincentius of Lerins and of Faustus, bishop of
Riez, which are parallel to the teaching of the creed, though they
cannot with any confidence be called quotations. They tend in
any case to prove that the <i>Quicumque</i> comes to us from the school
of Lerins, of which Honoratus was the first abbot, and to which
Caesarius also belonged.</p>

<p>The earliest use of the <i>Quicumque</i> was in sermons, in which
the clauses were quoted, as by the council of Toledo without
reference to the creed as a whole. From the 8th century, if
not from earlier times, commentaries were written on it. The
writer of the Oratorian Commentary (Theodulf of Orleans?)
addressing a synod which instructed him to provide an exposition
of this work on the faith, writes of it, as &ldquo;here and
there recited in our churches, and continually made the subject
of meditation by our priests.&rdquo; It was soon used as a canticle.
Angilbert, abbot of St Riquier (c. 814), records that it was sung
by his school in procession on rogation days. It passed into the
office of Prime, apparently first at Fleury. In the first Prayer
Book of Edward VI. it was &ldquo;sung or said&rdquo; after the Benedictus
on the greater feasts, and this use was extended in the second
Prayer Book. In 1662 the rubric was altered and it was substituted
for the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. It has no place in the offices of
the Eastern Orthodox Church, but is found, without the words
&ldquo;And the Son&rdquo; of clause 22, in the appendix of many modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
editions. In the Russian service books it appears at the beginning
of the psalter.</p>

<p>The controversy on its use in modern times has turned mainly
on the interpretation of the warning clauses. No new translation
can put an end to the difficulty. While it is true that the Church
has never condemned individuals, and that the warnings refer
only to those who have received the faith, and do not touch
the question of the unbaptized, there is a growing feeling that
they go beyond the teaching of Holy Scripture on the responsibility
of intellect in matters of faith.<a name="FnAnchor_13k" id="FnAnchor_13k" href="#Footnote_13k"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>On the other hand the creed is a valuable statement of Catholic
faith on the Trinity and the Incarnation, and its use for students
and teachers at least is by no means obsolete. The special
characteristic of its theology is in the first part where it owes
most to the teaching of Augustine, who in his striving after
self-knowledge analysed the mystery of his own triune personality
and illustrated it with psychological images, &ldquo;I exist
and I am conscious that I exist, and I love the existence and
the consciousness; and all this independently of any external
influence.&rdquo; Such a riper analysis of the mystery of his own
personality enabled him to arrive at a clearer conception of
the idea of divine personality, &ldquo;whose triunity has nothing
potential or unrealized about it; whose triune elements are
eternally actualized, by no outward influence, but from within;
a Trinity in Unity.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_14k" id="FnAnchor_14k" href="#Footnote_14k"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>II. <span class="sc">Modern Confessions of Faith.</span>&mdash;The second great
creed-making epoch of Church history opens in the 16th century
with the Confession of Augsburg. The famous theses which
Luther nailed to the door of the church at Wittenberg in 1517
cannot be called a confession, but they expressed a protest which
could not rest there. Some reconstruction of popular beliefs
was needed by many consciences. There is a striking contrast
between the crudeness of much and widely accepted medieval
theology and the decrees of the council of Trent. Even from the
Roman Catholic standpoint such a need was felt. Luther himself
had a gift of words which through his catechisms made the reformed
theology popular in Germany. In 1530 it became necessary
to define his position against both Romanists and Zwinglians.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Confession of Augsburg</i> was drawn up by Melanchthon,
revised by Luther, and presented to the emperor Charles V. at
the diet of Augsburg. Some 21 of its articles dealt
with doctrine, 7 with ecclesiastical abuses. It expounded
<span class="sidenote">Augsburg confession.</span>
in terse and significant teaching the doctrine
(1) of God, (2) of original sin, (3) of the Son of God, (4) of justification
..., (21) of the worship of saints. The abuses which
it was maintained had been corrected by Lutheranism were
discussed in articles (1) on Communion in both kinds, (2) on
the marriage of clergy, (3) on the Mass, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Augsburg,
Confession of</a></span>).</p>

<p>The main difference between these, the first of a long series
of articles of religion and the ancient creeds, lies in the fact that
they are manifestoes embodying creeds and answering more
than one purpose. This is the reason of their frequent failure
to convey any sense of proportion in the expression of truth.
The disciplinary question of clerical marriage is not of the same
primary importance as the doctrinal questions involved in the
restoration of the cup to the laity, or discussed in the subsequent
article on the mass. As has been well said by a learned Baptist
theologian, Dr Green: &ldquo;It was by a true divine instinct that the
early theologians made Christ Himself, in His divine-human personality,
their centre of the creeds.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_15k" id="FnAnchor_15k" href="#Footnote_15k"><span class="sp">15</span></a> The fundamental questions
of Christianity, exhibited in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, should be marked
off as standing on a higher plane than others. In this respect
catechisms of modern times, from Luther&rsquo;s down to the recent
Evangelical catechism of the Free Churches, and including
from their respective points of view both the catechism of the
Church of England and the catechism of the council of Trent, are
markedly superior to articles and synodical decrees. The failure
of the latter was really inevitable. In the 16th century a spirit
of universal questioning was rife, and it is this utter unsettlement
of opinion which is reflected in the discussions of doubts on
matters only remotely connected with &ldquo;the faith once for all
delivered unto the saints&rdquo; (Jude 3). Moreover, fresh complications
arose from the confusion in which the question of the duties
and rights of the civil power was entangled. In an age when the
foundations of the system on which society had rested for centuries
were seriously shaken, such subjects as the right of the
magistrate to interfere with the belief of the individual, and the
limits of his authority over conscience, naturally assumed a
prominence hitherto unknown.<a name="FnAnchor_16k" id="FnAnchor_16k" href="#Footnote_16k"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>2. <i>Other Lutheran Formularies.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of classification
it will be convenient to discuss Lutheran, Zwinglian and
Calvinistic confessions separately.</p>

<p>An elaborate <i>Apology</i> for the confession of Augsburg was drawn
up by Melanchthon in reply to Roman Catholic criticisms.
This, together with the confession, the articles of
Schmalkalden, drawn up by Luther in 1536, Luther&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Lutheran.</span>
catechisms, and the Formula of Concord which was an attempt
to settle doctrinal divisions promulgated in 1580, sum up what
is called &ldquo;the confessional theology of Lutheranism.&rdquo; Of less
influence in the subsequent history of Lutheranism, but of
interest as used by Archbishop Parker in the preparation of the
Elizabethan articles of 1563, is the confession of Württemberg.
It was presented to the council of Trent by the ambassador of the
state of Württemberg in 1552. Its thirty-five articles contain a
moderate statement of Lutheran teaching.</p>

<p>3. <i>Zwinglian and Calvinistic Confessions.</i>&mdash;The confession of
the Four Cities, Strassburg, Constance, Memmingen and London,
was drawn up by M. Bucer and was presented to Charles
V. at <span class="correction" title="amended from Ausburg">Augsburg</span> in 1530. These cities were inclined to
<span class="sidenote">Zwinglian and Calvinist.</span>
follow Zwingli in his sacramental teaching which was
more fully expressed in the Confession of Basel (1534)
and the First Helvetic Confession (1536). Calvin&rsquo;s views were
expressed in the Gallican Confession, containing forty articles,
which was drawn up in 1559, and was presented both to Francis II.
of France and to Charles IX. On the same lines the Belgian
Confession of 1561, written by Guido de Brès in French, and
translated into Dutch was widely accepted in the Netherlands
and confirmed by the synod of Dort (1619). The second Helvetic
Confession was the work of Bullinger, published at the request
of the Elector Palatine Frederick III. in 1566, and was held in
repute in Switzerland, Poland and France as well as the Palatinate.
It was sanctioned in Scotland and was well received
in England.</p>

<p>These confessions teach the root idea of Calvin&rsquo;s theology,
the immeasurable awfulness of God, His eternity, and the
immutability of His decrees. Such strict Calvinism was the
strength also of the Westminster Confession (see below), but was
soon weakened in Germany. This same Elector Frederick invited
two young divines, Zacharias Ursinus and Caspar Olevianus,
to prepare the afterwards celebrated Heidelberg catechism,
which in 1563 superseded Calvin&rsquo;s catechism in the Palatinate.
While Calvin began sternly with the question: &ldquo;What is the
chief end of human life?&rdquo; Ans.: &ldquo;That men may know God
by whom they were created,&rdquo;&mdash;the Heidelberg catechism has:
&ldquo;What is thy only comfort in life and death?&rdquo; Ans.: &ldquo;That I
with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but
belong to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This catechism
has been called the charter of the German Reformed Church.
It contains three divisions dealing with (1) man&rsquo;s sin, misery,
redemption, (2) the Trinity, (3) thankfulness, under which is
included all practical Christian life lived in gratitude for mercies
received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span></p>

<p>4. <i>English Articles of Religion.</i>&mdash;The ten articles of 1536
were drawn up by Convocation at the bidding of Henry VIII.
&ldquo;to stablysh Christian Quietnes and Unitie.&rdquo; They
exhibit a traditional character, a compromise between
<span class="sidenote">Articles of religion.</span>
the old and the new learning. Thus the
doctrine of the Real Presence is asserted, but no mention is
made of Transubstantiation. Medieval ceremonies are described
as useful but without power to remit sins. Two years later, after
negotiations with the Lutheran princes, a conference on theological
matters was held at Lambeth with Lutheran envoys. Thirteen
articles were drawn up, which, though never published (they were
found among Cranmer&rsquo;s papers at the beginning of the 19th
century), had some influence on the forty-two articles. Some
of them were taken from the confession of Augsburg, but the
sections on Baptism, the Eucharist and penance, show that the
English theologians desired to lay more emphasis on the character
of sacraments as channels of grace. The Statute of the Six Articles
(1539), &ldquo;the whip with six strings,&rdquo; was the outcome of the retrograde
policy which distinguished the latter years of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>With the accession of Edward VI. liturgical reforms were
set on foot before an attempt was made to systematize doctrinal
teaching. But as early as 1549 Cranmer had in hand &ldquo;Articles
of Religion&rdquo; to which he required all preachers and lecturers
to subscribe. In 1552 they were revised by other bishops and
were laid before the council and the royal chaplains. They were
then published as &ldquo;Articles agreed on by the bishops and other
learned men in the Synod of London.&rdquo; But there is considerable
doubt whether they really received the sanction of Convocation
(Gibson, p. 15). They were not devised as a complete scheme
of doctrine, but only as a guide in dealing with current errors of
(i.) the Medievalists and (ii.) the Anabaptists. Under (i.) they
condemned the doctrine of the school authors on congruous
merit (Art. xii.), the doctrine of grace <i>ex opere operato</i> (xxvi.).
Transubstantiation (xxix.). Under (ii.) they laid stress on the
fundamental articles of the faith (Art. i.-iv.), affirmed the Three
Creeds (vii.), since many Anabaptists held Arian and Socinian
opinions which were rife in Switzerland, Italy and Poland,
condemning also their views on original sin (viii.), community
of goods (xxxvii.), and on other subjects in articles which do not
mention them by name.</p>

<p>The revision undertaken in 1563 by Archbishop Parker,
aided by Edm. Guest, bishop of Rochester, shows &ldquo;an attempt to
give greater completeness to the formulary,&rdquo; and to make
clearer the Catholic position of the Church of England. For
the clause (Art. xxviii.) which denied the Real Presence was
substituted one by Guest with the desire &ldquo;not to deny the
reality of the presence of the Body of Christ in the Supper, but
only the grossness and sensibleness in the receiving thereof.&rdquo;
At the same time the substitution of &ldquo;Romish doctrine&rdquo; for
&ldquo;doctrine of School authors&rdquo; (Art. xxii.) marks an effort to define
the line of the Church of England sharply against current Roman
teaching. The revision was passed by Convocation and again
revised in 1571, when the queen had been excommunicated by
papal bull, and an act was passed ordering all clergy to subscribe
to them. They have remained unchanged ever since, though
the terms of subscription have been modified.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to add nine articles of a strong Calvinistic
tone, which were drawn up by Dr Whitaker, regius professor
of divinity at Cambridge, and submitted to Archbishop Whitgift.
They were rejected both by Queen Elizabeth, and, after the Hampton
Court Conference petitioned about them, by King James I.</p>

<p>The first Scottish confession dates from 1560. It is a memorial
of the intellectual power and enthusiasm of John Knox. It
exhibits the leading features of the Reformed theology, but
&ldquo;disclaims Divine authority for any fixed form of church government
or worship.&rdquo; It also asks that &ldquo;if anyone shall note in
this our confession any articles or sentence repugnant of God&rsquo;s
Holy Word, that it would please him of his gentleness and for
Christian charity&rsquo;s sake, to admonish of the same in writing,&rdquo;
promising that if the teaching cannot be proved, to reform it.
Between this and the Westminster Confession must be noted
the first Baptist confession, published in Amsterdam in 1611.
It shows the influence of Arminian theology against Calvinism,
which was vigorously upheld in the <i>Quin-particular</i> formula, put
forward by the synod of Dort in 1619 to uphold the five points of
Calvinism, after heated discussion, in which English delegates took
part, of the problems of divine omniscience and human free-will.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Westminster Confession</i> (1648), with its two catechisms,
is perhaps the ablest of the reformed confessions from the standpoint
of Calvinism. Its keynote is sovereignty.
&ldquo;The Decrees of God are His eternal Purpose according
<span class="sidenote">Westminster Confession.</span>
to the Counsel of His Will, whereby for His Own Glory
He hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.&rdquo;
Man&rsquo;s part is to accept them with submission. As the Anglican
divines soon ceased to attend the assembly, and the Independents
were few in number, it was the work of Presbyterians only, the
Scottish members carrying their proposal to make it an independent
document and not a mere revision of the Thirty-nine Articles.
After discussions lasting for two years it was debated in parliament,
finished on the 22nd of March 1648, and was adopted by
the Scottish parliament in the following year. It is the only
confession which has been imposed by authority of parliament
on the whole of the United Kingdom. This lasted in England for
ten years. In Scotland its influence has continued to the present
day, contributing not a little to mould the high qualities of
religious insight and courage and perseverance which have honourably
distinguished Scottish Presbyterians all the world over.
This was the last great effort in constructive theology of the
Reformation period. When Cromwell before his death in 1658
allowed a conference to prepare a new confession of faith for the
whole commonwealth, the Westminster Confession was accepted
as a whole with an added statement on church order and discipline.
We must note, however, that the Baptist divines who
were excluded from the Westminster Assembly issued a declaration
of their principles under the title, &ldquo;A Confession of Faith of
seven Congregations or Churches in London which are commonly
but unjustly called Anabaptists, for the Vindication of the Truth
and Information of the Ignorant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two other declarations may be quoted to show how necessary
such confessions are even to religious societies which refuse to be
bound by them. In 1675 Robert Barclay published an &ldquo;Apology
for the Society of Friends,&rdquo; in which he declared what they held
concerning revelation, scripture, the fall, redemption, the inward
light, freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>In 1833 the Congregational Union published a Declaration or
Confession of Faith, Church Order and Discipline. It was prepared
by Dr George Redford <span class="correction" title="amended from or">of</span> Worcester, and was presented, not as a
scholastic or critical confession of faith, but merely such a statement
as any intelligent member of the body might offer as containing
its leading principles. It deals with the Bible as the final
appeal in controversy, the doctrines of God, man, sin, the Incarnation,
the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, &ldquo;both the
Son of man and the Son of God,&rdquo; the work of the Holy Spirit, justification
by faith, the perpetual obligation of Baptism and the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, final judgment, the law of Christian fellowship.
The same principles have been lucidly stated in the Evangelical
Free Church catechism.</p>

<p>6. <i>Confessions in the Eastern Orthodox Church.</i>&mdash;The Eastern
Church has no general doctrinal tests beyond the Nicene Creed,
but from time to time synods have approved expositions
of the faith such as the Athanasian Creed
<span class="sidenote">Greek church.</span>
(without the words &ldquo;And the Son&rdquo;), and the
Orthodox Confession of the Catholic and Apostolic Eastern
Church. This was the work of Petrus Mogilas, metropolitan
of Kiev, and other theologians. It was written in 1640
in Russian, was translated into Greek, and approved by the
council of Jassy and the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria,
Antioch and Jerusalem. It was affirmed by the council
of Jerusalem in 1672, which also affirmed the Confession of
Dositheus, patriarch of Jerusalem. Both of these confessions
were drawn up to confute the teaching of a remarkable man who
had been patriarch of Constantinople, Cyril Lucar. He was a
student of Western theology, a correspondent of Archbishop
Laud, and had travelled in Germany and Switzerland. In 1629 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
published a confession in which he attempted to incorporate ideas
of the reformers while preserving the leading ideas of Eastern
traditional theology. The controversy chiefly turned on the
question of the necessity of episcopacy. Dositheus taught that
the existence of bishops is as necessary to the Church as &ldquo;breath
to a man and the sun to the world.&rdquo; Christ is the universal
and perpetual Head of the Church, but he exercises his rule by
means of &ldquo;the holy Fathers,&rdquo; that is, the bishops whom the
Holy Ghost has appointed to be in charge of local churches.</p>

<p>Mention may also be made of the longer catechism of the
Orthodox Catholic Church compiled by Philaret, metropolitan
of Moscow, revised and adopted by the Russian Holy Synod in
1839. The Church is defined as &ldquo;a divinely-instituted community
of men, united by the orthodox faith, the law of God, the hierarchy
and the sacraments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>7. <i>Roman Catholic Formularies.</i>&mdash;For our present purpose the
distinctive features of Roman Catholicism may be said to be
summed up in the decrees of the council of Trent and
the creed of Pope Pius IV. The council sat at intervals
<span class="sidenote">Roman Catholic.</span>
from 1545-1563, but there was a marked divergence
between the opinions advocated by prominent members of the
council and its final decrees. Cardinal Pole had to leave the
council because he advocated the doctrine of justification by
faith. Even at the later sessions the cardinal of Lorraine with
the French prelates supported the German representatives in
requests for the cup for the laity, the permission of the marriage of
priests, and the revision of the breviary. Finally the decisions
of the council were promulgated in a declaration of XII. articles,
usually called the Creed of Pius IV., which reaffirmed the Nicene
Creed, and dealt with the preservation of the apostolic and
ecclesiastical traditions, the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures
&ldquo;according to the sense which our Holy Mother Church has held,&rdquo;
the seven sacraments, the offering of the mass, transubstantiation,
purgatory, the veneration of saints, relics, images, the efficacy
of indulgences, the supremacy of the Roman Church and of the
bishop of Rome as vicar of Christ. To this summary of doctrine
should be added the dogmas of the immaculate conception of
the Blessed Virgin declared in 1854, and of papal infallibility
decreed by the Vatican council of 1870.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;In this survey of Christian confessions it has
been impossible to do more than barely name many which
deserve discussion. This is a subject which has grown in importance
and is likely to grow further. The very intensity of that
phase of modern thought which declaims fervently against all
creeds, and would maintain what George Eliot called &ldquo;the right
of the individual to general haziness,&rdquo; is likely to draw all
Christian thinkers nearer to one another in sympathy through
acceptance of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed as the common basis of Christian
thought. In the words of Hilary of Poitiers, &ldquo;Faith gathers
strength through opposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question at once arises. Can the simple historic faith be
maintained without adding theological interpretations, those
arid wastes of dogma in which the springs of faith and reverence
run dry? The answer is No. We cannot ask to be as if through
nineteen centuries no one had ever asked a question about the
relation of the Lord Jesus Christ to the Father and the Holy
Spirit. If we could come back to the Bible and use biblical terms
only, as Cyril of Jerusalem wished in his early days, we know
from experience that the old errors would reappear in the form
of new questions, and that we should have to pass through the
dreary wilderness of controversy from implicit to explicit dogma,
from &ldquo;I believe that Jesus is the Lord&rdquo; to the confession that
the Only Begotten Son is &ldquo;of one substance with the Father.&rdquo;
In the words of Hilary again:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Faithful souls would be contented with the word of God which
bids us: &lsquo;Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.&rsquo; But also we are
drawn by the faults of our heretical opponents to do things unlawful,
to scale heights inaccessible, to speak out what is unspeakable, to
presume where we ought not. And whereas it is by faith alone
that we should worship the Father and reverence the Son, and be
filled with the Spirit, we are now obliged to strain our weak human
language in the utterance of things beyond its scope; forced into
this evil procedure by the evil procedure of our foes. Hence what
should be matter of silent religious meditation must now needs be
imperilled by exposition in words.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The province of reverent theology is to aid accurate thinking
by the use of metaphysical or psychological terms. Its definitions
are no more an end in themselves than an analysis of good
drinking water, which by itself leaves us thirsty but encourages
us to drink. So the Nicene Creed is the analysis of the river of
the water of life of which the Sermon on the Mount is a description,
flowing on from age to age, freely offered to the thirsty souls
of men.</p>

<p>This justification of the ancient creeds carries with it the
justification of later confessions so far as they answered questions
which would be fatal to religion if they were not answered.
As Principal Stewart puts it very clearly: &ldquo;The answer given is
based on the philosophy or science of the period. It does not
necessarily form part of the religion itself, but is the best which
with the materials at its command, in its own defence and in
its love for truth, the religion (and its advocates) can give. But
the answers may be superseded by better answers, or they may
be rendered unnecessary because the questions are no longer
asked. Thus the Calvinism of the 16th and 17th centuries
elaborated answers to questions, which if no attempt had been
made to answer them, would have perplexed earnest souls and
condemned the system; but many parts of the system are now
obsolete, because the conditions which suggested the questions
which they sought to answer no longer exist or have no longer
any interest or importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREEK<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (Mid. Eng. <i>crike</i> or <i>creke</i>, common to many N.
European languages), a small inlet on a low coast, an inlet in
a river formed by the mouth of a small stream, a shallow narrow
harbour for small <span class="correction" title="amended from vessles">vessels</span>. In America and Australia especially
there are many long streams which can be everywhere forded and
sometimes dry up, and are navigable only at their tidal estuaries,
mere brooks in width which are of great economic importance.
They form complete river-systems, and are the only supply of
surface water over many thousand square miles. They are at
some seasons a mere chain of &ldquo;water-holes,&rdquo; but occasionally
they are strongly flooded. Since exploration began at the coast
and advanced inland, it is probable that the explorers, advancing
up the narrow inlets or &ldquo;creeks,&rdquo; used the same word for the
streams which flowed into these as they followed their courses
upward into the country. The early settlers would use the same
word for that portion of the stream which flowed through their
own land, and in Australia particularly the word has the same
local meaning as brook in England. On a map the whole system
is called a river, <i>e.g.</i> the river Wakefield in South Australia gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
its name to Port Wakefield, but the stream is always locally
called &ldquo;the creek.&rdquo;</p>

<i>maskoki</i>, &ldquo;creeks,&rdquo; in reference to the many creeks and rivulets
running through their country), a confederacy of North American
Indians, who formerly occupied most of Alabama and Georgia.
The confederacy seems to have been in existence in 1540, and then
included the Muskogee, the ruling tribe, whose language was
generally spoken, the Alabama, the Hichiti, Koasati and others
of the Muskogean stock, with the Yuchi and the Natchez,
a large number of Shawano and the Seminoles of Florida as a
branch. The Creeks were agriculturists living in villages of log
houses. They were brave fighters, but during the 18th century
only had one struggle, of little importance, with the settlers.
The Creek War of 1813-14 was, however, serious. The confederacy
was completely defeated in three hard-fought battles,
and the peace treaty which followed involved the cession to the
United States government of most of the Creek country. In the
Civil War the Creeks were divided in their allegiance and suffered
heavily in the campaigns. The so-called Creek nation is now
settled in Oklahoma, but independent government virtually
ceased in 1906. In 1904 they numbered some 16,000, some
two-thirds being of pure or mixed Creek blood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREETOWN,<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> a seaport of Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland.
Pop. (1901) 991. It is situated near the head of Wigtown Bay,
18 m. W. of Castle Douglas, but 23½ m. by the Portpatrick and
Wigtownshire Railway. The granite quarries in the vicinity
constitute the leading industry, the stone for the Liverpool docks
and other public works having been obtained from them. The
village dates from 1785, and it became a burgh of barony in
1792. Sir Walter Scott laid part of the scene of <i>Guy Mannering</i>
in this neighbourhood. Dr Thomas Brown, the metaphysician
(1778-1820), was a native of the parish (Kirkmabreck) in which
Creetown lies.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREEVEY, THOMAS<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> (1768-1838), English politician, son of
William Creevey, a Liverpool merchant, was born in that city
in March 1768. He went to Queen&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and
graduated as seventh wrangler in 1789. The same year he became
a student at the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar
in 1794. In 1802 he entered parliament through the duke of
Norfolk&rsquo;s nomination as member for Thetford, and married
a widow with six children, Mrs Ord, who had a life interest in a
comfortable income. Creevey was a Whig and a follower of Fox,
and his active intellect and social qualities procured him a considerable
intimacy with the leaders of this political circle. In
1806, when the brief &ldquo;All the Talents&rdquo; ministry was formed, he
was given the office of secretary to the Board of Control; in
1830, when next his party came into power, Creevey, who had
lost his seat in parliament, was appointed by Lord Grey treasurer
of the ordnance; and subsequently Lord Melbourne made him
treasurer of Greenwich hospital. After 1818, when his wife died,
he had very slender means of his own, but he was popular with
his friends and was well looked after by them; Greville, writing
of him in 1829, remarks that &ldquo;old Creevey is a living proof that
a man may be perfectly happy and exceedingly poor. I think
he is the only man I know in society who possesses nothing.&rdquo;
He died in February 1838. He is remembered through the
<i>Creevey Papers</i>, published in 1903 under the editorship of Sir
Herbert Maxwell, which, consisting partly of Creevey&rsquo;s own
journals and partly of correspondence, give a lively and valuable
picture of the political and social life of the late Georgian era,
and are characterized by an almost Pepysian outspokenness.
They are a useful addition and correction to the <i>Croker Papers</i>,
written from a Tory point of view. For thirty-six years Creevey
had kept a &ldquo;copious diary,&rdquo; and had preserved a vast miscellaneous
correspondence with such people as Lord Brougham, and
his step-daughter, Elizabeth Ord, had assisted him, by keeping
his letters to her, in compiling material avowedly for a collection
of Creevey Papers in the future. At his death it was found that
he had left his mistress, with whom he had lived for four years,
his sole executrix and legatee, and Greville notes in his <i>Memoirs</i>
the anxiety of Brougham and others to get the papers into their
hands and suppress them. The diary, mentioned above, did not
survive, perhaps through Brougham&rsquo;s success, and the papers
from which Sir Herbert Maxwell made his selection came into
his hands from Mrs Blackett Ord, whose husband was the grandson
of Creevey&rsquo;s eldest step-daughter.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREFELD,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Krefeld</span>, a town of Germany, in the Prussian
Rhine province, on the left side of and 3 m. distant from the
Rhine, 32 m. N.W. from Cologne, and 15 m. N.W. from Düsseldorf,
with which it is connected by a light electric railway. Pop. (1875)
62,905; (1905) 110,410. The town is one of the finest in the
Rhine provinces, being well and regularly built, and possessing
several handsome squares and attractive public gardens. A
striking point about the inner town is that it forms a large rectangle,
enclosed by four wide boulevards or &ldquo;walls.&rdquo; This feature,
rare in German towns, is due to the fact that Crefeld was always
an &ldquo;open place,&rdquo; and that therefore the circular form of a
fortress town could be dispensed with. It has six Roman Catholic
and four Evangelical churches (of which the Gothic Friedenskirche
with a lofty spire, and the modern church of St Joseph, in
the Romanesque style, are alone worth special mention); there
are also a Mennonite and an Old Catholic church. The town hall,
decorated with frescoes by P. Janssen (b. 1844), and the Kaiser
Wilhelm Museum are the most noteworthy secular buildings.
In the promenades are monuments to Moltke, Bismarck and
Karl Wilhelm, the composer of the <i>Wacht am Rhein</i>. Among the
schools and scientific institutions of the town the most important
is the higher grade technical school for the study of the textile
industries, which is attended by students from all parts of the
world. Connected with this are subsidiary schools, notably one
for dyeing and finishing.</p>

<p>Crefeld is the most important seat of the silk and velvet
manufactures in Germany, and in this industry the larger part
of the population of town and neighbourhood is employed.
There are upwards of 12,000 silk power-looms in operation, and
the value of the annual output in this branch alone is estimated
at £3,000,000. A special feature is the manufacture of silk for
covering umbrellas; while of its velvet manufacture that of velvet
ribbon is the chief. The other industries of the town, notably
dyeing, stuff-printing and stamping, are very considerable,
and there are also engineering and machine shops, chemical,
cellulose, soap, and other factories, breweries, distilleries and
tanneries. The surrounding fertile district is almost entirely
laid out in market gardens. Crefeld is an important railway
centre, and has direct communication with Cologne, Rheydt,
München-Gladbach and Holland (via Zevenaar).</p>

<p>Crefeld is first mentioned in records of the 12th century.
From the emperor Charles IV. it received market rights in 1361
and the status of a town in 1373. It belonged to the counts of
Mörs, and was annexed to Prussia, with the countship, in 1702.
It remained a place of little importance until the 17th century,
when religious persecution drove to it a number of Calvinists and
Separatists from Jülich and Berg (followed later by Mennonites),
who introduced the manufacture of linen. The number of such
immigrants still further increased in the 18th century, when,
the silk industry having been introduced from Holland, the town
rapidly developed. The French occupation in 1795 and the
resulting restriction of trade weighed for a while heavily upon
the new industry; but with the termination of the war and the
re-establishment of Prussian rule the old prosperity returned.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREIGHTON, MANDELL<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> (1843-1901), English historian and
bishop of London, was born at Carlisle on the 5th of July 1843,
being the eldest son of Robert Creighton, a well-to-do upholsterer
of that city. He was educated at Durham grammar school and
at Merton College, Oxford, where he was elected to a postmastership
in 1862. He obtained a first-class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and
a second in law and modern history in 1866. In the same year he
became tutor and fellow of Merton. He was ordained deacon, on
his fellowship, in 1870, and priest in 1873; in 1872 he had
married Louise, daughter of Robert von Glehn, a London
merchant (herself a writer of several successful books of history).
Meanwhile he had published several small historical works;
but his college and university duties left little time for writing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
and in 1875 he accepted the vicarage of Embleton, a parish on
the coast of Northumberland, near Dunstanburgh, with an
ancient and beautiful church and a fortified parsonage house,
and within reach of the fine library in Bamburgh Keep. Here
he remained for nearly ten years, acquiring that experience of
parochial work which afterwards stood him in good stead, taking
private pupils, studying and writing, as well as taking
an active part in diocesan business. Here too he planned and
wrote the first two volumes of his chief historical work, the
<i>History of the Papacy</i>; and it was in part this which led to his
being elected in 1884 to the newly-founded Dixie professorship
of ecclesiastical history at Cambridge, where he went into
residence early in 1885. At Cambridge his influence at once
made itself felt, especially in the reorganization of the historical
school. His lectures and conversation classes were extraordinarily
good, possessing as he did the rare gift of kindling the
enthusiasm without curbing the individuality of his pupils.
In 1886 he combined with other leading historians to found the
<i>English Historical Review</i>, of which he was editor for five years.
Meanwhile the vacations were spent at Worcester, where he had
been nominated a canon residentiary in 1885. In 1891 he was
made canon of Windsor; but he never went into residence,
being appointed in the same year to the see of Peterborough.
He threw himself with characteristic energy into his new work,
visiting, preaching and lecturing in every part of his diocese.
He also found time to preach and lecture elsewhere, and to deliver
remarkable speeches at social functions; he worked hard with
Archbishop Benson on the Parish Councils Bill (1894); he became
the first president of the Church Historical Society (1894), and
continued in that office till his death; he took part in the Laud
Commemoration (1895); he represented the English Church at
the coronation of the tsar (1896). He even found time for
academical work, delivering the Hulsean lectures (1893-1894)
and the Rede lecture (1894) at Cambridge, and the Romanes
lecture at Oxford (1896).</p>

<p>In 1897, on the translation of Dr Temple to Canterbury, Bishop
Creighton was transferred to London. During Dr Temple&rsquo;s
episcopate ritual irregularities of all kinds had grown up, which
left a very difficult task to his successor, more especially in view
of the growing public agitation on the subject, of which he had
to bear the brunt. As was only natural, his studied fairness
did not satisfy partisans on either side; and his efforts towards
conciliation laid him open to much misunderstanding. His
administration, none the less, did much to preserve peace. He
strained every nerve to induce his clergy to accept his ruling
on the questions of the reservation of the Sacrament and of the
ceremonial use of incense in accordance with the archbishop&rsquo;s
judgment in the Lincoln case; but when, during his last illness,
a prosecutor brought proceedings against the clergy of five
recalcitrant churches, the bishop, on the advice of his archdeacons,
interposed his veto. One other effort on behalf of
peace may be mentioned. In accordance with a vote of the
diocesan conference, the bishop arranged the &ldquo;Round Table
Conference&rdquo; between representative members of various
parties, held at Fulham in October 1900, on &ldquo;the doctrine of the
Holy Eucharist and its expression in ritual,&rdquo; and a report of
its proceedings was published with a preface by him. The true
work of his episcopate was, however, positive, not negative.
He was an excellent administrator; and his wide knowledge,
broad sympathies, and sound common sense, though they placed
him outside the point of view common to most of his clergy,
made him an invaluable guide in correcting their too often indiscreet
zeal. He fully realized the special position of the
English Church in Christendom, and firmly maintained its
essential teaching. Yet he was no narrow Anglican. His love
for the English Church never blinded him to its faults, and no
man was less insular than he. As he was a historian before he
became a bishop, so it was his historical sense which determined
his general attitude as a bishop. It was this, together with a
certain native taste for ecclesiastical pomp, which made him&mdash;while
condemning the unhistorical extravagances of the ultra-ritualists&mdash;himself
a ritualist. He was the first bishop of London,
since the Reformation, to &ldquo;pontificate&rdquo; in a mitre as well as the
cope, and though no man could have been less essentially
&ldquo;sacerdotal&rdquo; he was always careful of correct ceremonial
usage. His interests and his sympathies, however, extended
far beyond the limits of the church. He took a foremost part
in almost every good work in his diocese, social or educational,
political or religious; while he found time also to cultivate
friendly relations with thinking men and women of all schools,
and to help all and sundry who came to him for advice and
assistance. It was this multiplicity of activities and interests
that proved fatal to him. By degrees the work, and especially
the routine work, began to tell on him. He fell seriously ill
in the late summer of 1900, and died on the 14th of January 1901.
He was buried in St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral, where a statue surmounts
his tomb.</p>

<p>He was a man of striking presence and distinguished by a fine
courtesy of manner. His <span class="correction" title="amended from irrespressible">irrepressible</span> and often daring humour,
together with his frank distaste for much conventional religious
phraseology, was a stumbling-block to some pious people. But
beneath it all lay a deep seriousness of purpose and a firm faith
in what to him were the fundamental truths of religion.</p>

<p>Bishop Creighton&rsquo;s principal published works are: <i>History of
the Papacy during the Period of the Reformation</i> (5 vols., 1882-1897,
new ed.); <i>History of the Papacy from the Great Schism
to the Sack of Rome</i> (6 vols., 1897); <i>The Early Renaissance in
England</i> (1895); <i>Cardinal Wolsey</i> (1895); <i>Life of Simon de
Montfort</i> (1876, new ed. 1895); <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> (1896). He also
edited the series of <i>Epochs of English History</i>, for which he
wrote &ldquo;The Age of Elizabeth&rdquo; (13th ed., 1897); <i>Historical
Lectures and Addresses by Mandell Creighton, &amp;c.</i>, edited by
Mrs Creighton, were published in 1903.</p>

32 m. N. of Paris on the Northern railway, on which it is an
important junction. Pop. (1906) 9234. The town is situated on
the Oise, on which it has a busy port. The manufacture of
machinery, heavy iron goods and nails, and copper and iron
founding, are important industries, and there are important
metallurgical and engineering works at Montataire, about 2 m.
distant; bricks and tiles and glass are also manufactured, and
the Northern railway has workshops here. The church (12th
to 15th centuries) is in the Gothic style. There are some traces
of a castle in which Charles VI. resided during the period of his
madness. Creil played a part of some importance in the wars of
the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRELL<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Krell</span>), <span class="bold">NICHOLAS</span> (c. 1551-1601), chancellor of
the elector of Saxony, was born at Leipzig, and educated at the
university of his native town. About 1580 he entered the service
of Christian, the eldest son of Augustus I., elector of Saxony,
and when Christian succeeded his father as elector in 1586, became
his most influential counsellor. Crell&rsquo;s religious views were
Calvinistic or Crypto-Calvinistic, and both before and after his
appointment as chancellor in 1589 he sought to substitute his
own form of faith for the Lutheranism which was the accepted
religion of electoral Saxony. Calvinists were appointed to many
important ecclesiastical and educational offices; a translation of
the Bible with Calvinistic annotations was brought out; and
other measures were taken by Crell to attain his end. In foreign
politics, also, he sought to change the traditional policy of
Saxony, acting in unison with John Casimir, administrator
of the Rhenish Palatinate, and promising assistance to Henry IV.
of France. These proceedings, coupled with the jealousy felt
at Crell&rsquo;s high position and autocratic conduct, made the chancellor
very unpopular, and when the elector died in October
1591 he was deprived of his offices and thrown into prison by
order of Frederick William, duke of Saxe-Altenburg, the regent
for the young elector Christian II. His trial was delayed until
1595, and then, owing partly to the interference of the imperial
court of justice (<i>Reichskammergericht</i>), dragged on for six years.
At length it was referred by the emperor Rudolph II. to a court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
of appeal at Prague, and sentence of death was passed. This
was carried out at Dresden on the 9th of October 1601.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREMA,<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Lombardy, Italy, in the
province of Cremona, 26 m. N.E. by rail from the town of
Cremona. Pop. (1901) town, 8027; commune, 9609. It is
situated on the right bank of the Serio, 240 ft. above sea-level,
in the centre of a rich agricultural district. The cathedral has a
fine Lombard Gothic façade of the second half of the 14th century;
the campanile belongs to the same period; the rest of the church
has been restored in the baroque style. The clock tower opposite
dates from the period of Venetian dominion in the 16th and 17th
centuries. The castle, which was one of the strongest in Italy,
was demolished in 1809. The church of S. Maria, ¾ m. E. of the
town, was begun in 1490 by Giov. Batt. Battaggio; it is in the
form of a Greek cross, with a central dome, and the exterior is
a fine specimen of polychrome Lombard work (E. Gussalli in
<i>Rassegna d&rsquo; arte</i>, 1905, p. 17).</p>

<p>The date of the foundation of Crema is uncertain. In the
10th century it appears to have been the principal place of the
territory known as Isola Fulcheria. In the 12th century it
was allied with Milan and attacked by Cremona, but was taken
and sacked by Barbarossa in 1160. It was rebuilt in 1185.
It fell under the Visconti in 1338, and joined the Lombard
republic in 1447; but was taken by the Venetians in 1449, and,
except from 1509 to 1529, remained under their dominion
until 1797.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREMATION<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> (Lat. <i>cremare</i>, to burn), the burning of human
corpses. This method of disposal of the dead may be said to have
been the general practice of the ancient world, with the important
exceptions of Egypt, where bodies were embalmed, Judaea,
where they were buried in sepulchres, and China, where they were
buried in the earth. In Greece, for instance, so well ascertained
was the law that only suicides, unteethed children, and persons
struck by lightning were denied the right to be burned. At
Rome, one of the XII. Tables said, &ldquo;Hominem mortuum in urbe
ne sepelito, neve urito&rdquo;; and in fact, from the close of the
republic to the end of the 4th Christian century, burning on the
pyre or rogus was the general rule.<a name="FnAnchor_1l" id="FnAnchor_1l" href="#Footnote_1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Whether in any of these
cases cremation was adopted or rejected for sanitary or for
superstitious reasons, it is difficult to say. Embalming would
probably not succeed in climates less warm and dry than the
Egyptian. The scarcity of fuel might also be a consideration.
The Chinese are influenced by the doctrine of Feng-Shui, or
incomprehensible wind water; they must have a properly placed
grave in their own land, and with this view their corpses are sent
home from long distances abroad. Even the Jews used cremation
in the vale of Tophet when a plague came; and the modern
Jews of Berlin and the Spanish and Portuguese Jews at Mile
End cemetery were among the first to welcome the lately revived
process. Probably also, some nations had religious objections
to the pollution of the sacred principle of fire, and therefore
practised exposure, suspension, throwing into the sea, cave-burial,
desiccation or envelopment.<a name="FnAnchor_2l" id="FnAnchor_2l" href="#Footnote_2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Some at least of these
methods must obviously have been suggested simply by the
readiest means at hand. Cremation is still practised over a great
part of Asia and America, but not always in the same form.
Thus, the ashes may be stored in urns, or buried in the earth,
or thrown to the wind, or (as among the Digger Indians) smeared
with gum on the heads of the mourners. In one case the three
processes of embalming, burning and burying are gone through;
and in another, if a member of the tribe die at a great distance
from home, some of his money and clothes are nevertheless
burned by the family. As food, weapons, &amp;c., are sometimes
buried with the body, so they are sometimes burned with the
body, the whole ashes being collected.<a name="FnAnchor_3l" id="FnAnchor_3l" href="#Footnote_3l"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The Siamese have a
singular institution, according to which, before burning, the
embalmed body lies in a temple for a period determined by the
rank of the dead man,&mdash;the king for six months, and so downwards.
If the poor relatives cannot afford fuel and the other
necessary preparations, they bury the body, but exhume it for
burning when an opportunity occurs.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the practice of cremation in
modern Europe was at first stopped, and has since been prevented
in great measure, by the Christian doctrine of the resurrection
of the body; partly also by the notion that the Christian&rsquo;s body
was redeemed and purified.<a name="FnAnchor_4l" id="FnAnchor_4l" href="#Footnote_4l"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Some clergymen, however, as the
late Mr Haweis in his <i>Ashes to Ashes, a Cremation Prelude</i>
(London, 1874), have been prominent in favour of cremation.
The objection of the clergy was disposed of by the philanthropist
Lord Shaftesbury when he asked, &ldquo;What would in such a case
become of the blessed martyrs?&rdquo; The very general practice of
burying bodies in the precincts of a church in order that the
dead might take benefit from the prayers of persons resorting to
the church, and the religious ceremony which precedes both European
burials and Asiatic cremations, have given the question a
religious aspect. It is, however, in the ultimate resort, really a
sanitary one. The disgusting results of pit-burial made cemeteries
necessary. But cemeteries are equally liable to overcrowding,
and are often nearer to inhabited houses than the old
churchyards. It is possible, no doubt, to make a cemetery safe
approximately by selecting a soil which is dry, close and porous,
by careful drainage, and by rigid enforcement of the rules
prescribing a certain depth (8 to 10 ft.) and a certain superficies
(4 yds.) for graves. But a great mass of sanitary objections may
be brought against even recent cemeteries in various countries.
A dense clay, the best soil for preventing the levitation of gas,
is the worst for the process of decomposition. The danger is
strikingly illustrated in the careful planting of trees and shrubs
to absorb the carbonic acid. Vault-burial in metallic coffins,
even when sawdust charcoal is used, is still more dangerous
than ordinary burial. It must also be remembered that the
cemetery system can only be temporary. The soil is gradually
filled with bones; houses crowd round; the law itself permits
the reopening of graves at the expiry of fourteen years. We
shall not, indeed, as Browne says, &ldquo;be knaved out of our graves
to have our skulls made drinking bowls and our bones turned
into pipes!&rdquo; But on this ground of sentiment cremation would
certainly prevent any interruption of that &ldquo;sweet sleep and
calm rest&rdquo; which the old prayer that the earth might lie lightly
has associated with the grave. And in the meantime we should
escape the horror of putrefaction and of the &ldquo;small cold worm
that fretteth the enshrouded form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Europe Christian burial was long associated entirely with the
ordinary practice of committing the corpse to the grave. But
in the middle of the 19th century many distinguished physicians
and chemists, especially in Italy, began prominently to advocate
cremation. In 1874, a congress called to consider the matter at
Milan resolved to petition the Chamber of Deputies for a clause
in the new sanitary code, permitting cremation under the supervision
of the syndics of the commune. In Switzerland Dr
Vegmann Ercolani was the champion of the cause (see his
<i>Cremation the most Rational Method of Disposing of the Dead</i>,
4th ed., Zurich, 1874). So long ago as 1797 cremation was
seriously discussed by the French Assembly under the Directory,
and the events of the Franco-Prussian War again brought the
subject under the notice of the medical press and the sanitary
authorities. The military experiments at Sédan, Chalons and
Metz, of burying large numbers of bodies with quicklime, or
pitch and straw, were not successful, but very dangerous. The
matter was considered by the municipal council of Paris in connexion
with the new cemetery at Méry-sur-Oise; and the prefect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
of the Seine in 1874 sent a circular asking information to all the
cremation societies in Europe. In Britain the subject had
slumbered for two centuries, since in 1658 Sir Thomas Browne
published his quaint <i>Hydriotaphia, or Urn-burial</i>, which was
mainly founded on the <i>De funere Romanorum</i> of the learned
Kirchmannus. In 1817 Dr J. Jamieson gave a sketch of the
&ldquo;Origin of Cremation&rdquo; (<i>Proc. Royal Soc. Edin.</i>, 1817), and for
many years prior to 1874 Dr Lord, medical officer of health for
Hampstead, continued to urge the practical necessity for the
introduction of the system.</p>

<p>It was Sir Henry Thompson, however, who first brought the
question prominently before the public. Thompson&rsquo;s problem
was&mdash;&ldquo;Given a dead body, to resolve it into carbonic acid, water
and ammonia, rapidly, safely and not unpleasantly.&rdquo; To solve
this problem, experiments were made by Dr Polli at the Milan
gas works, fully described in Dr Pietra Santa&rsquo;s book, <i>La Crémation
des morts en France et à l&rsquo;étranger</i>, and by Professor Brunetti,
who exhibited an apparatus at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873,
and who stated his results in <i>La Cremazione dei cadaveri</i> (Padua,
1873). Polli obtained complete incineration or calcination of
dogs by the use of coal-gas mixed with atmospheric air, applied
to a cylindrical retort of refracting clay, so as to consume the
gaseous products of combustion. The process was complete
in two hours, and the ashes weighed about 5% of the weight
before cremation. Brunetti used an oblong furnace of refracting
brick with side-doors to regulate the draught, and above a cast-iron
dome with movable shutters. The body was placed on
a metallic plate suspended on iron wire. The gas generated
escaped by the shutters, and in two hours carbonization was
complete. The heat was then raised and concentrated, and at the
end of four hours the operation was over; 180 &#8468; of wood costing
2s. 4d. sterling was burned. In a reverberating furnace used by
Sir Henry Thompson a body, weighing 144 &#8468;, was reduced in
fifty minutes to about 4 &#8468; of lime dust. The noxious gases,
which were undoubtedly produced during the first five minutes
of combustion, passed through a flue into a second furnace and
were entirely consumed. In the ordinary Siemens regenerative
furnace (which was adapted by Reclam in Germany for cremation,
and also by Sir Henry Thompson) only the hot-blast was
used, the body supplying hydrogen and carbon; or a stream
of heated hydrocarbon mixed with heated air was sent from a
gasometer supplied with coal, charcoal, peat or wood,&mdash;the brick
or iron-cased chamber being thus heated to a high degree before
cremation begins.</p>

<p>Steps were at once taken to form an English society to promote
the practice of cremation. A declaration of its objects was
drawn up and signed on the 13th January 1874 by the following
persons&mdash;Shirley Brooks, William Eassie, Ernest Hart, the
Rev. H. R. Haweis, G. H. Hawkins, John Cordy Jeaffreson, F.
Lehmann, C. F. Lord, W. Shaen, A. Strahan, (Sir) Henry Thompson,
Major Vaughan, Rev. C. Voysey and (Sir) T. Spencer Wells;
and they frequently met to consider the necessary steps in order
to attain their object. The laws and regulations having been
thoroughly discussed, the membership of the society was constituted
by an annual contribution for expenses, and a subscription
to the following declaration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;We disapprove the present custom of burying the dead, and
desire to substitute some mode which shall rapidly resolve the
body into its component elements by a process which cannot offend
the living, and shall render the remains absolutely innocuous.
Until some better method is devised, we desire to adopt that usually
known as cremation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, on 29th April a meeting was held, a council was
formed, and Sir H. Thompson was elected president and chairman.
Mr Eassie (who in 1875 published a valuable work on
<i>Cremation of the Dead</i>) was at the same time appointed honorary
secretary.<a name="FnAnchor_5l" id="FnAnchor_5l" href="#Footnote_5l"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In 1875 the following were added:&mdash;Mrs Rose Mary
Crawshay, Mr Higford Burr, Rev. J. Long, Mr W. Robinson
and the Rev. Brooke Lambert. Subsequently followed Lord
Bramwell, Sir Chas. Cameron, Dr Farquharson, Sir Douglas
Galton, Lord Playfair, Mr Martin Ridley Smith, Mr James A.
Budgett, Mr Edmund Yates, Mr J. S. Fletcher, Mr J. C. Swinburne-Hanham,
the duke of Westminster (on Lord Bramwell&rsquo;s
death), and Sir Arthur Arnold. These may be considered the
pioneers of the movement for reform.</p>

<p>On account of difficulties and prejudices<a name="FnAnchor_6l" id="FnAnchor_6l" href="#Footnote_6l"><span class="sp">6</span></a> the council was unable
to purchase a freehold until 1878, when an acre was obtained
at Woking, not far distant from the cemetery. At this time the
furnace employed by Professor Gorini of Lodi, Italy, appeared
to be the best for working with on a small scale; and he was
invited to visit England to superintend its erection. This was
completed in 1879, and the body of a horse was cremated
rapidly and completely without any smoke or effluvia from the
chimney. No sooner was this successful step taken than the
president received a communication from the Home Office,
which resulted in a personal interview with the home secretary;
the issue of which was that if the society desired to avoid direct
hostile action, an assurance must be given that no cremation
should be attempted without leave first obtained from the
minister. This of course was given, no further building took
place, and the society&rsquo;s labours were confined to employing
means to diffuse information on the subject. Sir Spencer Wells
brought it before the annual meeting of the British Medical
Association in 1880, when a petition to the home secretary for
permission to adopt cremation was largely signed by the leading
men in town and country, but without any immediate result.
The next important development was an application to the
council in 1882, by Captain Hanham in Dorsetshire, to undertake
the cremation of two deceased relatives who had left express instructions
to that effect. The home secretary was applied to, and
refused. The bodies were preserved, and Captain Hanham erected
a crematorium on his estate, and the cremation took place there.
He himself, dying a year later, was cremated also; in both cases
the result was attained under the supervision of Mr J. C. Swinburne-Hanham,
who succeeded Mr Eassie in 1888 as honorary
secretary to the society. The government took no notice. But
in 1883 a cremation was performed in Wales by a man on the body
of his child, and legal proceedings were taken against him. Mr
Justice Stephen, in February 1884, delivered his well-known
judgment at the Assizes there, declaring cremation to be a
legal procedure, provided no nuisance were caused thereby to
others. The council of the society at once declared themselves
absolved from their promise to the Home Office, and publicly
offered to perform cremation, laying down strict rules for careful
inquiry into the cause of death in every case. They stated that
they were fully aware that the chief practical objection to cremation
was that it removed traces of poison or violence which
might have caused death. Declining to trust the very imperfect
statement generally made respecting the cause of death in the
ordinary death certificate (unless a coroner&rsquo;s inquest had been
held), they adopted a system of very stringent inquiry, the result
of which in each case was to be submitted to the president, to
be investigated and approved by him before cremation could take
place, with the right to decline or require an inquest if he thought
proper; and this course has been followed ever since the first
cremation.</p>

<p>It was on 26th March 1885 that the first cremation at
Woking took place, the subject being a lady.<a name="FnAnchor_7l" id="FnAnchor_7l" href="#Footnote_7l"><span class="sp">7</span></a> In 1888 it became
necessary, nearly 100 bodies having been by this date cremated,
to build a large hall for religious service, as well as waiting-rooms,
in connexion with the crematorium there. The dukes of Bedford
and Westminster headed the appeal for funds, each with £105.
The former (the 9th duke of Bedford) especially took great
interest in the progress of the society, and offered to furnish
further donations to any extent necessary. During the next
two years he generously defrayed costs to the amount of £3500,
and built a smaller crematorium adjacent for himself and family.
The latter building was first used on the 18th of January 1891,
a few days after the duke&rsquo;s own death. The number of cremations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
slowly increased year by year, and the total at the end of
1900 was 1824. Many of these were persons of distinction&mdash;by
rank, or by attainments in art, literature and science, or in
public life.</p>

<p>The council next turned their attention to the need for a
national system of death certification, to be enforced by law
as an essential and much-needed reform in connexion
with cremation. On the 6th of January 1893 the duke
<span class="sidenote">Death certification.</span>
of Westminster introduced a deputation to the secretary
of state for the home department, Mr Asquith, and the
president of the Cremation Society opened the case, showing that
no less than 7% of the burials in England took place without any
certificate, while in some districts it was far greater. In consequence
of this the home secretary appointed a select committee
of the House of Commons, which was presided over by Sir Walter
Foster, of the Local Government Board, to &ldquo;inquire into the
sufficiency of the existing law as to the disposal of the dead ...
and especially for detecting the causes of death due to poison,
violence, and criminal neglect.&rdquo; After a prolonged inquiry
and careful consideration of the evidence, a full report and
conclusions drawn therefrom were unanimously agreed to, and
published as a blue-book in the autumn of 1893.<a name="FnAnchor_8l" id="FnAnchor_8l" href="#Footnote_8l"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following conclusions are quoted from this volume:&mdash;Page iii.
&ldquo;So far as affording a record of the true cause of death and the
detection of it in cases where death may have been due to violence,
poison, or where criminal neglect is concerned, the class of certified
deaths leaves much to be desired.&rdquo; Page iv. Certification is extremely
important as a deterrent of crime, and numerous proofs are
given at length in support of the statement.... &ldquo;Contrast this
class with that of uncertified deaths, when the result is such as to
force upon your Committee the conviction that vastly more deaths
occur annually from foul play and criminal neglect than the law
recognizes.&rdquo; Page vii. Great uncertainty in resorting to the coroner&rsquo;s
court, and want of system in connexion with the practice of it, are
affirmed to exist. Page x. It is stated that the opportunity for
perpetrating crime is great in the considerable class of uncertified
cases ... &ldquo;in short, the existing procedure plays into the hands of
the criminal classes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your Committee are much impressed with
the serious possibilities implied in a system which permits death
and burial to take place without the production of satisfactory
medical evidence of the cause of death.&rdquo; Page xii. &ldquo;Your Committee
have arrived at the conclusion that the appointment of medical
officials, who should investigate all cases of death which are not
certified by a medical practitioner in attendance, is a proposal which
deserves their support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In considering cremation, the committee reported as follows:&mdash;Page
xxii. &ldquo;Your Committee are of opinion that there is only one
question in connexion with this method of disposing of a dead body
to which it is necessary for them to refer. That question is the supposed
danger to the community arising from the fact that with the
destruction of the body the possibility of obtaining evidence of the
cause of death by <i>post-mortem</i> examination also disappears.&rdquo; The
mode of proceeding adopted by the Cremation Society of England
having been described, &ldquo;your Committee are of opinion that with the
precautions adopted in connexion with cremation, as carried out by
the Cremation Society, there is little probability that cases of crime
would escape detection, but inasmuch as these precautions are
purely voluntary, your Committee consider that in the interests of
public safety such regulations should be enforced by law.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The Cremation Society felt that this report much strengthened
the case for legislation amending the law of death certification.
In August 1894 the president of the society laid the results of the
select committee before the British Medical Association at
Bristol, and a unanimous vote was obtained in favour of the
suggestions made by it. In November a second deputation
waited on Mr Asquith, in which the president of the society
begged him to carry out the system recommended. The home
secretary replied that the business belonged to the department
of the Local Government Board, and that it was already dealing
with the question and bringing it to a satisfactory solution. Soon
afterwards, however, the government changed, other questions
became pressing and further consideration of the subject was
postponed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With reference to the recommendations of the select committee
before mentioned, the regulations necessary for registration of
death and the disposal of the dead may be outlined as follows:&mdash;
(1) That no body should be buried, cremated, or otherwise disposed
of without a medical certificate of death signed, after personal
knowledge and observation, or by information obtained after investigation
made by a qualified medical officer appointed for the
purpose. (2) A qualified medical man should be appointed as official
certifier in every parish, or district of neighbouring parishes, his duty
being to inquire into all cases of death and report the cause in
writing, together with such other details as may be deemed necessary.
This would naturally fall within the duties of the medical
officer of health for the district, and registration should be made
at his office. (3) If the circumstances of death obviously demand
a coroner&rsquo;s inquest, the case should be transferred to his court and
the cause determined, with or without autopsy. If there appears
to be no ground for holding an inquest, and autopsy be necessary
to the furnishing of a certificate, the official certifier should make it,
and state the result in his report. (4) No person or company should
be henceforth permitted to construct or use an apparatus for cremating
human bodies without license from the Local Government Board
or other authority. (5) No crematory should be so employed unless
the site, construction, and system of management have been approved
after survey by an officer appointed by government for the
purpose. But the licence to construct or use a crematory should
not be withheld if guarantees are given that the conditions required
are or will be complied with. All such crematories to be subject at
all times to inspection by an officer appointed by the government.
(6) The burning of a human body, otherwise than in an officially
recognized crematory, should be illegal, and punishable by penalty.
(7) No human body should be cremated unless the official examiner
added the words &ldquo;Cremation permitted.&rdquo; This he should be bound
to do if, after due inquiry, he can certify that the deceased has died
from natural causes, and not from ill-treatment, poison or violence.</p>
</div>

<p>The Cremation Act 1902 (2 Ed. VII. ch. 8), and the regulations<a name="FnAnchor_9l" id="FnAnchor_9l" href="#Footnote_9l"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
made thereunder by the home secretary, have since
given legislative effect to some of the foregoing recommendations
and have laid down a code of laws applicable and binding where
cremation is resorted to. But the amendments in the law of
death certification generally, so long pressed for by the Cremation
Society of England and recommended by the select committee,
are none the less necessary.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in populous communities and in crowded
districts the burial of dead bodies is liable to be a source of
danger to the living. As early as 1840 a commission had been
appointed, including some of the earliest authorities on sanitary
science,&mdash;namely, Drs Southwood Smith, Chadwick, Milroy,
Sutherland, Waller Lewis and others,&mdash;to conduct a searching
inquiry into the state of the burial-grounds of London and large
provincial towns. By the report<a name="FnAnchor_10l" id="FnAnchor_10l" href="#Footnote_10l"><span class="sp">10</span></a> the existence of such a danger
was strikingly demonstrated, and intramural interments were in
consequence made illegal. The advocates of burial then declared
that interment in certain light soils would safely and efficiently
decompose the putrefying elements which begin to be developed
the moment death takes place, and which rapidly become
dangerous to the living, still more so in the case of deaths from
contagious disease. But these light dry soils and elevated spots
are precisely those best adapted for human habitation; to say
nothing of their value for food-production. Granted the
efficiency of such burial, it only effects in the course of a few
years what exposure to a high temperature accomplishes with
absolute safety in an hour. In a densely populated country
the struggle between the claims of the dead and the living to
occupy the choicest sites becomes a serious matter. All decaying
animal remains give off effluvia&mdash;gases&mdash;which are transferred
through the medium of the atmosphere to become converted into
vegetable growth of some kind&mdash;trees, crops, garden produce,
grass, &amp;c. Every plant absorbs these gases by its leaves, each
one of which is provided with hundreds of stomata&mdash;open mouths&mdash;by
which they fix or utilize the carbon to form woody fibre,
and give off free oxygen to the atmosphere. Thus it is that the
air we breathe is kept pure by the constant interaction between
the animal and vegetable kingdoms. It may be taken as certain
that the gaseous products arising from a cremated body&mdash;amounting,
although invisible, to no less than 97% of its weight,
3% only remaining as solids, in the form of a pure white ash&mdash;become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
in the course of a few hours integral and active elements
in some form of vegetable life. The result of this reasoning has
been that, by slow degrees, crematoria have been constructed
at many of the populous cities in Great Britain and abroad
(see <i>Statistics</i> below).</p>

<p>The subject of employing cremation for the bodies of those
who die of contagious disease is a most important one. Sir H.
Thompson advocated this course in a paper read before the
International Congress of Hygiene held in London in 1891; and
a resolution strongly approving the practice was carried unanimously
at a large meeting of experts and medical officers of health.
Such diseases are small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, consumption,
malignant cholera, enteric, relapsing and puerperal fevers,
the annual number of deaths from which in the United Kingdom
is upwards of 80,000. Complete disinfection takes place by
means of the high temperature to which the body is exposed.
At the present day it is compulsory to report any case in the
foregoing list, whenever it occurs, to the medical officer of health
for the district; and it is customary to disinfect the rooms
themselves, as well as the clothes and furniture used by the
patient if the case be fatal; but the body, which is the source
and origin of the evil, and is itself loaded with the germs of a
specific poison, is left to the chances which attach to its preservation
in that condition, when buried in a fit or unfit soil or
situation.</p>

<p>The process of preparing a body for cremation requires a brief
notice. The plan generally adopted is to place it (in the usual
shroud) in a light pine shell, discarding all heavy oak or other
coffin, and to introduce it into the furnace in that manner.
Thus there is no handling or exposure of the body after it reaches
the crematorium. The type of furnace in general use is on the
reverberatory principle, the body being consumed in a separate
chamber heated to over 2000° Fahr. by a coke fire. In a few
instances a furnace burning ordinary illuminating gas instead of
coke is in use.</p>
<div class="author">(H. Th.)</div>

<p><i>Statistics.</i>&mdash;The following statistics show the history of modern
cremation and its progress at home and abroad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Foreign Countries.</i>&mdash;The first experiment in Italy was made by
Brunetti in 1869, his second and third in 1870. Gorini and Polli
published their first cases in 1872. Brunetti exhibited his at Vienna
in 1873. All were performed in the open air. The next in Europe
was a single case at Breslau in 1874. Soon after, an English lady
was cremated in a closed apparatus (Siemens) at Dresden. The next
cremation in a closed receptacle took place at Milan in 1876. In
the same year a Cremation Society was formed, a handsome building
was erected, and two Gorini furnaces were at work in 1880. In
1899 the total number of cremations was 1355. In Italy 28 crematoria
exist, viz. at Alessandria, Asti, Bologna, Bra, Brescia, Como,
Cremona, Florence, Genoa, Leghorn, Lodi, Mantua, Milan, Modena,
Novara, Padua, Perugia, Pisa, Pistoia, Rome, San Remo, Siena,
Spezia, Turin, Udine, Verona and Venice. The total number of
cremations in Italy in 1906 was 440.</p>

<p>In Germany the first crematorium was erected at Gotha; it was
opened in 1878, and the total cremations down to September 1st, 1907,
numbered 4584. At Ohlsdorf, Hamburg, the crematorium was
opened in November 1892, and the total cremations down to
September 1st, 1907, numbered 2521. At Heidelberg the crematorium
was opened in 1891, and the total cremations down to
September 1st, 1907, numbered 1741. Throughout the German
empire there are, in addition to the above, crematoria at Bremen,
Eisenach, Jena, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Mainz, Offenbach, Heilbronn,
Ulm, Chemnitz and Stuttgart, besides over eighty societies for promoting
cremation. The total number of cremations which took
place in Germany in 1906 was 2057, making a total of 13,614 down
to September 1st, 1907.</p>

<p>Other societies exist in Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Sweden,
Norway and Switzerland. At the crematorium at Copenhagen
77 bodies were cremated in 1906, the total being 500. The Stockholm
crematorium was opened in October 1887, and the cremations
in 1906 numbered 56. The Gothenburg crematorium (also in
Sweden) was opened in January 1890, and the cremations there
in 1906 were 14. Switzerland has four crematoria, viz. at Basel,
Geneva, Zurich and St Gallen&mdash;524 cremations took place in that
country in 1906.</p>

<p>In Paris a cremation society was founded in 1880, and in 1886-1887
a large crematorium was constructed by the municipal council
at Père Lachaise, containing three Gorini furnaces. It was first
used in October 1887 for two men who died of small-pox. The
demand became large; an improved furnace was soon devised, the
unclaimed bodies at the hospitals and the remains at the dissecting
rooms being cremated there, besides a large number of embryos.
In 1906 the number, including the last-named class, was 6906.
The total number of incinerations at Père Lachaise down to
December 31st, 1906 (including both classes) was 86,962; but the
employment of cremation for the purposes named has deterred a
resort to it by many. Had a separate establishment been organized
for the public, its success would have been greater. A magnificent
edifice has been constructed by the municipality of Paris for the
conservation of the ashes of persons who have been cremated.
Crematoria have been established also at Rouen, Rheims and
Marseilles, and the construction of crematoria in other of the great
provincial centres of France was in contemplation.</p>

<p>In Buenos Aires, since 1844, the bodies of all persons dying of
contagious disease are cremated, and there is also a separate establishment
for the use of the public.</p>

<p>At Tokio in Japan no fewer than 22 crematoria exist, and about
an equal number of cremations and burials in earth take place.</p>

<p>At Calcutta a crematorium was opened in 1906.</p>

<p>At Montreal, Canada, there is a crematorium which began operations
in 1902, and completed 44 cremations up to the 31st of
December 1905.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;There were 33 crematoria in the United States on
September 1st, 1907. At Fresh Pond, New York, erected in 1885,
the total number of cremations to December 31st, 1906, being 8514.
At Buffalo, N.Y., the first cremation taking place in 1885, and the
total number down to December 31st, 1905, being 787. At Troy
(Earl Crematorium), N. Y., the first cremation taking place in 1890, and

<p><i>United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;There were 13 crematoria in operation in the
United Kingdom on September 1st, 1907. The oldest is that at
Woking, Surrey, which was first used for the cremation of human
remains in 1885. In that year three cremations took place there,
the number gradually increasing each year until in 1901 301 bodies
were cremated. Up to September 1st, 1907, the total number of
cremations at Woking was 2939. Then followed the crematorium
at Manchester, opened in 1892 with 90 in 1906 and a total of 1085;
at Glasgow, opened in 1895 with 45 in 1906 and a total of 252; at
Liverpool, opened in 1896, with 46 in 1906 and a total of 374; at
Hull, opened in 1901 (the first municipal crematorium), with 17 in
1906 and a total of 116; at Darlington, also opened in 1901, with 13
in 1906 and a total of 33. The Leicester Corporation crematorium
was opened in 1902, with 12 in 1906 and a total of 50. Next in order
came the Golder&rsquo;s Green crematorium, Hampstead, London, which
was opened in December 1902. In 1906 298 cremations took place
there, making a total of 1091. After this followed the Birmingham
crematorium, opened in 1903, with 21 in 1906 and a total of 84; the
City of London crematorium at Little Ilford, opened in 1905, with
23 for 1906 and a total of 46; the Leeds crematorium, opened in
1905, with 15 in 1906 and a total of 42; the Bradford Corporation
crematorium, opened in 1905, with 13 in 1906, and a total of 20;
and the Sheffield Corporation crematorium, opened in 1905, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
6 in 1906 and a total of 26. Thus there were 739 cremations in the
United Kingdom in 1906, making a total at the above crematoria
down to September 1st, 1907, of 6158. The Golder&rsquo;s Green crematorium,
situated on the northern boundary of Hampstead Heath,
stands in its own grounds of 12 acres, and is but 35 minutes&rsquo; drive
from Oxford Circus. London thus has two crematoria within
driving distance of its centre, and the Woking crematorium within
easy reach of the south-west suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREMER, JAKOBUS JAN<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> (1837-1880), Dutch novelist, born
at Arnhem in September 1837, started life as a painter, but soon
exchanged the brush for the pen. The great success of his first
novelettes (<i>Betuwsche Novellen</i> and <i>Overbetuwsche Novellen</i>),
published about 1855&mdash;reprinted many times since, and translated
into German and French&mdash;showed Cremer the wisdom of
his new departure. These short stories of Dutch provincial life
are written in the quaint dialect of the Betuwe, the large flat
Gelderland island, formed by the Rhine, the name recalling the
presumed earliest inhabitants, the Batavi. Cremer is strongest
in his delineation of character. His picturesque humour, coming
out, perhaps, most forcibly in his numerous readings of the
Betuwe novelettes, soon procured him the name of the &ldquo;Dutch
Fritz Reuter.&rdquo; In his later novels Cremer abandons both the
language and the slight love-stories of the Betuwe, depicting
the Dutch life of other centres in the national tongue. The
principal are: <i>Anna Rooze</i> (1867), <i>Dokter Helmond en zijn Vrouw</i>
(1870), <i>Hanna de Freule</i> (1873), <i>Daniel Sils</i>, &amp;c. Cremer was
less successful as a playwright, and his two comedies, <i>Peasant
and Nobleman</i> and <i>Emma Bertholt</i>, did not enhance his fame;
nor did a volume of poems, published in 1873. He died at the
Hague in June 1880. His collected novels have appeared at
Leiden. An English novel, founded by Albert Vandam upon
<i>Anna Rooze</i>, considered by many his best work, was published
in London (1877, 3 vols.) under the title of <i>An Everyday Heroine</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREMERA<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span> (mod. <i>Fosso della Valchetta</i>), a small stream in
Etruria which falls into the Tiber about 6 m. N. of Rome. The
identification with the Fosso della Valchetta is fixed as correct
by the account in Livy ii. 49, which shows that the Saxa Rubra
were not far off, and this we know to be the Roman name of the
post station of Prima Porta, about 7 m. from Rome on the Via
Flaminia. It is famous for the defeat of the three hundred Fabii,
who had established a fortified post on its banks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÉMIEUX, ISAAC MOÏSE<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> [known as <span class="sc">Adolphe</span>] (1796-1880),
French statesman, was born at Nîmes, of a rich Jewish family.
He began life as an advocate in his native town. After the revolution
of 1830 he came to Paris, formed connexions with numerous
political personages, even with King Louis Philippe, and became
a brilliant defender of Liberal ideas in the law courts and in the
press,&mdash;witness his <i>Éloge funèbre</i> of the bishop Grégoire (1830),
his <i>Mémoire</i> for the political rehabilitation of Marshal Ney (1833),
and his plea for the accused of April (1835). Elected deputy in
1842, he was one of the leaders in the campaign against the
Guizot ministry, and his eloquence contributed greatly to the
success of his party. On the 24th of February 1848 he was chosen
by the Republicans as a member of the provisional government,
and as minister of justice he secured the decrees abolishing
the death penalty for political offences, and making the office
of judge immovable. When the conflict between the Republicans
and Socialists broke out he resigned office, but continued to sit
in the constituent assembly. At first he supported Louis
Napoleon, but when he discovered the prince&rsquo;s imperial ambitions
he broke with him. Arrested and imprisoned on the 2nd of
December 1851, he remained in private life until November 1869,
when he was elected as a Republican deputy by Paris. On the 4th
of September 1870 he was again chosen member of the government
of national defence, and resumed the ministry of justice.
He then formed part of the Delegation of Tours, but took no
part in the completion of the organization of defence. He
resigned with his colleagues on the 14th of February 1871.
Eight months later he was elected deputy, then life senator in
1875. He died on the 10th of February 1880. Crémieux did
much to better the condition of the Jews. He was president of
the Universal Israelite Alliance, and while in the government
of the national defence he secured the franchise for the Jews in
Algeria. This famous <i>Décret Crémieux</i> was the origin of the anti-Semitic
movement in Algiers. Crémieux published a <i>Recueil</i>
of his political cases (1869), and the <i>Actes de la délégation de Tours
et de Bordeaux</i> (2 vols., 1871).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREMONA, LUIGI<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (1830-1903), Italian mathematician, was
born at Pavia on the 7th of December 1830. In 1848, when
Milan and Venice rose against Austria, Cremona, then only a
lad of seventeen, joined the ranks of the Italian volunteers, and
remained with them, fighting on behalf of his country&rsquo;s freedom,
till, in 1849, the capitulation of Venice put an end to the hopeless
campaign. He then returned to Pavia, where he pursued his
studies at the university under Francesco Brioschi, and determined
to seek a career as teacher of mathematics. His first
appointment was as elementary mathematical master at the
gymnasium and lyceum of Cremona, and he afterwards obtained
a similar post at Milan. In 1860 he was appointed to the professorship
of higher geometry at the university of Bologna, and in
1866 to that of higher geometry and graphical statics at the
higher technical college of Milan. In this same year he competed
for the Steiner prize of the Berlin Academy, with a treatise
entitled &ldquo;Memoria sulle superficie de terzo ordine,&rdquo; and shared
the award with J. C. F. Sturm. Two years later the same prize
was conferred on him without competition. In 1873 he was
called to Rome to organize the college of engineering, and was
also appointed professor of higher mathematics at the university.
Cremona&rsquo;s reputation had now become European, and in 1879 he
was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Society. In
the same year he was made a senator of the kingdom of Italy.
He died on the 10th of June 1903.</p>

<p>As early as 1856 Cremona had begun to contribute to the
<i>Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche</i>, and to the <i>Annali di
matematica</i>, of which he became afterwards joint editor. Papers
by him have appeared in the mathematical journals of Italy,
France, Germany and England, and he has published several
important works, many of which have been translated into other
languages. His manual on <i>Graphical Statics</i> and his <i>Elements
of Projective Geometry</i> (translated by C. Leudesdorf), have been
published in English by the Clarendon Press. His life was
devoted to the study of higher geometry and reforming the more
advanced mathematical teaching of Italy. His reputation mainly
rests on his <i>Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane</i>,
which proclaims him as a follower of the Steinerian or synthetical
school of geometricians. He notably enriched our knowledge of
curves and surfaces.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREMONA,<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> a city and episcopal see of Lombardy, Italy,
the capital of the province of Cremona, situated on the N. bank
of the Po, 155 ft. above sea-level, 60 m. by rail S.E. of Milan.
Pop. (1901) town, 31,655; commune, 39,344. It is oval in shape,
and retains its medieval fortifications. The line of the streets
is as a rule irregular, but the town as a whole is not very
picturesque.</p>

<p>The finest building is the cathedral, in the Lombard Romanesque
style, begun in 1107 and consecrated in 1190. The wheel
window of the main façade dates from 1274. The transepts,
added in the 13th and 14th centuries (before 1370), have picturesque
brick façades, with fine terra-cotta ornamentation. The
great Torrazzo, a tower 397 ft. high, which stands by the cathedral,
and is connected with it by a series of galleries, dates from 1267-1291.
It is square below, with an octagonal summit of a slightly
later period. The main façade of the cathedral was largely
altered in 1491, to which date the statues upon it belong; the
portico in front was added in 1497. The building would be
much improved by isolation, which it is hoped may be effected.
The interior is fine, and is covered with frescoes by Cremonese
masters of the 16th century (Boccaccio Boccaccino, Romanino,
Pordenone, the Campi, &amp;c.), which are not of first-rate importance.
The choir has fine stalls of 1489-1490, upon one of which
there is a view of the façade of the cathedral before its alteration
in 1491. The treasury contains a richly worked silver crucifix
9 ft. high, of 1478, the base of which was added in 1774-1775.
It contains 408 statues and busts altogether, the central three
of which belong to an earlier cross of 1231. Adjacent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
cathedral is the octagonal baptistery of 1167, 92 ft. in height
and 75 ft. in external diameter, also in the Lombard Romanesque
style. The so-called Campo Santo, close to the baptistery,
contains a mosaic pavement with emblematic figures belonging
probably to the 8th and 9th centuries, and running under the
cathedral. Of the other churches, S. Michele has a simple and
good Lombard Romanesque 13th-century façade, and a plain
interior of the 10th century; and S. Agata a good campanile in
the former style. Many of them contain paintings by the later
Cremonese masters, especially Galeazzo Campi (d. 1536) and his
sons Giulio and Antonio. The latter are especially well represented
in S. Sigismondo, 1½ m. outside the town to the E. On the
side of the Piazza del Comune opposite to the cathedral are two
13th-century Gothic palaces in brick, the Palazzo Comunale and
the former Palazzo dei Giureconsulti, now the seat of the commissioners
for the water regulation of the district. Another
palace of the same period is now occupied by the Archivio
Notarile. The modern Palazzo Ponzoni contains a museum
and a technical institute. In front of it is a statue of the composer
Amilcare Ponchielli, who was a native of Cremona. The
Palazzo Fodri, now the Monte di Pietà, has a beautiful 15th-century
frieze of terra-cotta bas-reliefs, as have some other
palaces in private hands.</p>

<p>Cremona was founded by the Romans in 218 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (the same
year as Placentia) as an outpost against the Gallic tribes. It
was strengthened in 190 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the sending of 6000 new settlers
and soon became one of the most flourishing towns of upper
Italy. It probably acquired municipal rights in 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but
Augustus, owing to the fact that it did not support him, assigned
a part of its territory to his veterans in 41 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and henceforth it
is once more called <i>colonia</i>. It remained prosperous (we may note
that Virgil came here to school from Mantua) until it was taken
and destroyed by the troops of Vespasian after the second battle
of Betriacum (Bedriacum) in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 69; the temple of Mefitis
alone being left standing (see Tacitus, <i>Hist.</i> iii. 15 seq.). One of
the bronze plates which decorated the exterior of the war-chest
of the <i>legio III. Macedonica</i>, one of the legions which had been
defeated at Betriacum, has been found near Cremona itself
(F. Barnabei in <i>Notiz. scavi</i>, 1887, p. 210). Vespasian ordered
its immediate reconstruction, but it never recovered its former
prosperity, though its position on the N. bank of the Po, at the
meeting-point of roads from Placentia, Mantua (the Via Postumia
in both cases), Brixellum (where the roads from Cremona and
Mantua to Parma met and crossed the river), Laus Pompeia
and Brixia, still gave it considerable importance. It was
destroyed once more by the Lombards under Agilulf in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 605,
and rebuilt in 615, and was ruled by dukes; but in the 9th
century the bishops of Cremona began to acquire considerable
temporal power. Landulf, a German to whom the see was
granted by Henry II., was driven out in 1022, and his palace
destroyed, but other Germans were invested with the see afterwards.
The commune of Cremona is first mentioned in a document
of 1098, recording its investiture by the countess Matilda
with the territory known as Isola Fulcheria. It had to sustain
many wars with its neighbours in order to maintain itself in its
new possessions. In the war of the Lombard League against
Barbarossa, Cremona, after having shared in the destruction of
Crema in 1160 and Milan in 1162, finally joined the league, but
took no part in the battle of Legnano, and thus procured itself
the odium of both sides. In the Guelph and Ghibelline struggles
Cremona took the latter side, and defeated Parma decisively in
1250. It was during this period that Cremona erected its finest
buildings. There was, however, a Guelph reaction in 1264; the
city was taken and sacked by Henry VII. in 1311, and was a prey
to struggles between the two parties, until Galeazzo Visconti
took possession of it in 1322. In 1406 it fell under the sway
of Cabrino Fondulo, who received with great festivities both the
emperor Sigismund and Pope John XXIII., the latter on his way
to the council at Constance; he, however, handed it over to
Filippo Maria Visconti in 1419. In 1499 it was occupied by
Venetians, but in 1512 it came under Massimiliano Sforza.
In 1535, like the rest of Lombardy, it fell under Spanish domination,
and was compelled to furnish large money contributions.
The population fell to 10,000 in 1668. The surprise of the
French garrison on the 2nd of February 1702, by the Imperialists
under Prince Eugene, was a celebrated incident of the War of the
Spanish Succession. The Imperialists were driven from Cremona
after a sharp struggle, but captured Marshal Villeroi, the French
commander. Hence the celebrated verse:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Français, rendons grâce à Bellone;</p>
<p class="i05">Notre bonheur est sans égal;</p>
<p class="i05">Nous avons conservé Cremoneé,</p>
<p class="i05">Et perdu notre général.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In the 18th century the prosperity of Cremona revived. In the
Italian republic it was the capital of the department of the upper
Po. Like the rest of Lombardy it fell under Austria in 1814,
and became Italian in 1859.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREMORNE GARDENS,<a name="ar214" id="ar214"></a></span> formerly a popular resort by the
side of the Thames in Chelsea, London, England. Originally the
property of the earl of Huntingdon (c. 1750), father of Steele&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Aspasia,&rdquo; who built a mansion here, the property passed
through various hands into those of Thomas Dawson, Baron
Dartrey and Viscount Cremorne (1725-1813), who greatly
beautified it. It was subsequently sold and converted into a
proprietary place of entertainment, being popular as such from
1845 to 1877. It never, however, acquired the fashionable fame
of Vauxhall, and finally became so great an annoyance to
residents in the neighbourhood that a renewal of its licence was
refused; and the site of the gardens was soon built over. The
name survives in Cremorne Road.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRENELLE<a name="ar215" id="ar215"></a></span> (an O. Fr. word for &ldquo;notch,&rdquo; mod. <i>créneau</i>; the
origin is obscure; cf. &ldquo;cranny&rdquo;), a term generally considered
to mean an embrasure of a battlement, but really applying to
the whole system of defence by battlements. In medieval times
no one could &ldquo;crenellate&rdquo; a building without special licence
from his supreme lord.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREODONTA,<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> a group of primitive early Tertiary Carnivora,
characterized by their small brains, the non-union in most cases
of the scaphoid and lunar bones of the carpus, and the general
absence of a distinct pair of &ldquo;sectorial&rdquo; teeth (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>).
In many respects the Lower Eocene creodonts come very close
to the primitive ungulates, or Condylarthra (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phenacodus</a></span>),
from which, however, they are distinguished by the approximation
in the form of the skull to the carnivorous type, the more
trenchant teeth (at least in most cases) and the more claw-like
character of the terminal joints of the toes. The general character
of the dentition in the more typical forms, such as <i>Hyaenodon</i>
(see fig.), recalls that of the carnivorous marsupials, this being
especially the case with the Patagonian species, which have been
separated as a distinct group under the name of Sparassodonta
(<i>q.v.</i>). The skull, however, is not of the marsupial type, and in
the European forms at any rate there is a complete replacement
of the milk-molars by pre-molars, while the minute structure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
the enamel of the teeth is of the carnivorous as distinct from
the marsupial type. The head is large in proportion to the body,
the lumbar region is unusually rigid, owing to the complexity of
the articulations, and the tail and hind-limbs are relatively long
and powerful. In life the tail probably passed almost imperceptibly
into the body, as in the Tasmanian thylacine.</p>

<p>That the Creodonta are the ancestors of the modern Carnivora
is now generally admitted. They are apparently the most
generalized and primitive of all (placental?) mammals, and
probably the direct descendants of the mammal-like anomodont
or theromorphous reptiles of the Triassic epoch; the evolution
from that group having perhaps taken place in Africa or in the
lost area connecting that continent with India. The relationship
of the creodonts to the carnivorous marsupials is not yet determined,
but it seems scarcely probable that the remarkable
resemblance existing between the teeth of the two groups can be
solely due to parallelism; and it has been suggested by Dr L.
Wortman that both creodonts and marsupials are descended
from a common non-placental stock. In other words, the latter
are a side-branch from the anomodont-creodont line of descent.
Dr C. W. Andrews has pointed out that certain of the Egyptian
creodonts appear to have been aquatic or subaquatic in their
habits; and it is possible that from such types are derived the
true seals, or <i>Phocidae</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of Australasia, and perhaps South Africa,
creodonts (on the supposition that the Patagonian forms are
rightly included) appear to have had a nearly world-wide distribution.
In Europe and North America they date from the
Lowest Eocene and lived till the early Oligocene, while in India
they apparently survived till a much later epoch. Some of the
Oligocene forms, alike as regards dentition, the union of the
scaphoid and lunar of the carpus, and the complexity of the
brain, approximated to modern Carnivora.</p>

<p>As regards classification Mr W. D. Matthew includes in the
typical family <i>Hyaenodontidae</i> not only the widely spread genera
<i>Hyaenodon</i> and <i>Pterodon</i>, but likewise <i>Sinopa</i> (<i>Stypolophus</i>),
<i>Cynohyaenodon</i> and <i>Proviverra</i>; but <i>Viverravus</i> (<i>Didymictis</i>)
and <i>Vulpavus</i> (<i>Miacis</i>) are assigned to a separate family (<i>Viverravidae</i>).
It is these latter forms which come nearest to modern
Carnivora, most of them being of Oligocene age. The American
and European <i>Oxyaena</i> apparently represents a family by itself,
as does the American <i>Oxyclaena</i>; and <i>Palaeonictis</i> and <i>Patriofelis</i>
are assigned to yet another family; while the North American
Lower Eocene and Eocene <i>Arctocyon</i> typifies a family characterized
by the somewhat bear-like type of dentition. <i>Mesonyx</i>
is also a very distinct type, from the North American Eocene
and Oligocene. Some of the species of <i>Patriofelis</i> and <i>Hyaenodon</i>
attained the size of a tiger, although with long civet-like skulls.
In the earlier forms the claws often retained somewhat of a hoof-like
character.</p>

<p>The South American <i>Borhyaenidae</i> include <i>Borhyaena</i>, <i>Prothylacinus</i>,
<i>Amphiproviverra</i>, and allied forms from the Santa Cruz
beds of Patagonia, and have been referred to a distinct group,
the Sparassodonta, mainly on account of the alleged replacement
of some only of the milk-molars by premolars. By their first
describer, Dr F. Ameghino, they were regarded as nearly related
to the marsupials, to which group they were definitely referred
in 1905 by Mr W. J. Sinclair, by whom they are considered
near akin to <i>Thylacinus</i>, but this view seems to be disproved by
the investigations of Mr C. S. Tomes into the structure of the
dental enamel.</p>

<p>It should be added that Dr J. L. Wortman transfers <i>Viverravus</i>
and its allies, together with <i>Palaeonictis</i>, to the true Carnivora,
the latter genus being regarded as the ancestral type of the sabre-toothed
cats (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Machaerodus</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREOLE<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> (the Fr. form of <i>criollo</i>, a West Indian, probably a
negro corruption of the Span, <i>criadillo</i>, the dim. of <i>criado</i>, one
bred or reared, from <i>criar</i>, to breed, a derivative of the Lat.
<i>creare</i>, to create), a word used originally (16th century) to denote
persons born in the West Indies of Spanish parents, as distinguished
from immigrants direct from Spain, aboriginals,
negroes or mulattos. It is now used of the descendants of non-aboriginal
races born and settled in the West Indies, in various
parts of the American mainland and in Mauritius, Reunion and
some other places colonized by Spain, Portugal, France, or (in
the case of the West Indies) by England. In a similar sense the
name is used of animals and plants. The use of the word by
some writers as necessarily implying a person of mixed blood is
totally erroneous; in itself &ldquo;creole&rdquo; has no distinction of colour;
a Creole may be a person of European, negro, or mixed extraction&mdash;or
even a horse.</p>

<p>Local variations occur in the use of the word as applied to
people. In the West Indies it designates the descendants of any
European race; in the United States the French-speaking native
portion of the white race in Louisiana, whether of French or
Spanish origin. The French Canadians are never termed creoles,
nor is the word now used of the South Americans of Spanish or
Portuguese descent, but in Mexico whites of pure Spanish extraction
are still called creoles. In all the countries named,
when a non-white creole is indicated the word negro is added.
In Mauritius, Reunion, &amp;c., on the other hand, creole is commonly
used to designate the black population, but is also occasionally
used of the inhabitants of European descent. The difference in
type between the white creoles and the European races from
whom they have sprung, a difference often considerable, is due
principally to changed environment&mdash;especially to the tropical
or semi-tropical climate of the lands they inhabit. The many
patois founded on French and Spanish, and used chiefly by creole
negroes, are spoken of as creole languages, a term extended by
some writers to include similar dialects spoken in countries
where the word creole is rarely used.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREON,<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span> in Greek legend, son of Menoeceus, king of Thebes
after the death of Laius, the husband of his sister Jocasta.
Thebes was then suffering from the visitation of the Sphinx, and
Creon offered his crown and the hand of the widowed queen to
whoever should solve the fatal riddle. Oedipus, the son of Laius,
ignorant of his parentage, successfully accomplished the task
and married Jocasta, his mother. By her he had two sons,
Eteocles and Polyneices, who agreed after their father&rsquo;s death
to reign in alternative years. Eteocles first ascended the throne,
being the elder, but at the end of the year refused to resign,
whereupon his brother attacked him at the head of an army
of Argives. The war was to be decided by a single combat
between the brothers, but both fell. Creon, who had resumed
the government during the minority of Leodamas, the son of
Eteocles, commanded that the Argives, and above all Polyneices,
the cause of all the bloodshed, should not receive the rites of
sepulture, and that any one who infringed this decree should be
buried alive. Antigone, the sister of Polyneices, refused to obey,
and sprinkled dust upon her brother&rsquo;s corpse. The threatened
penalty was inflicted; but Creon&rsquo;s crime did not escape unpunished.
His son, Haemon, the lover of Antigone, killed
himself on her grave; and he himself was slain by Theseus.
According to another account he was put to death by Lycus,
the son or descendant of a former ruler of Thebes (Euripides,
<i>Herc. Fur.</i> 31; Apollodorus iii. 5, 7; Pausanias ix. 5).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREOSOTE,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> <span class="sc">Creasote</span> or <span class="sc">Kreasote</span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="kreas">&#954;&#961;&#941;&#945;&#962;</span>, flesh,
and <span class="grk" title="sôzein">&#963;&#974;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to preserve), a product of the distillation of coal,
bone oil, shale oil, and wood-tar (more especially that made
from beech-wood). The creosote is extracted from the distillate
by means of alkali, separated from the filtered alkaline solution
by sulphuric acid, and then distilled with dilute alkali; the
distillate is again treated with alkali and acid, till its purification
is effected; it is then redistilled at 200° C., and dried by means
of calcium chloride. It is a highly refractive, colourless, oily
liquid, and was first obtained in 1832 by K. Reichenbach from
beech-wood tar. It consists mainly of a mixture of phenol,
cresol, guaiacol, creosol, xylenol, dimethyl guaiacol, ethyl
guaiacol, and various methyl ethers of pyrogallol. Creosote has
a strong odour and hot taste, and burns with a smoky flame.
It dissolves sulphur, phosphorus, resins, and many acids and
colouring matters; and is soluble in alcohol, ether, and carbon
disulphide, and in 80 parts by volume of water. It is distinguished
from carbolic acid by the following properties:&mdash;it
rotates the plane of polarized light to the right, forms with
collodion a transparent fluid, and is nearly insoluble in glycerin;
whereas carbolic acid has no effect on polarized light, gives with
about two-thirds of its volume of collodion a gelatinous mass,
and is soluble in all proportions in glycerin; further, alcohol and
ferric chloride produce with creosote a green solution, turned
brown by water, with carbolic acid a brown, and on the addition
of water a blue solution. Creosote, like carbolic acid, is a
powerful antiseptic, and readily coagulates albuminous matter;
wood-smoke and pyroligneous acid or wood-vinegar owe to its
presence their efficacy in preserving animal and vegetable substances
from putrefaction.</p>

<p><i>Creosote oil</i> is the name generally applied to the fraction of the
coal tar distillate which boils between 200° and 300° C. (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coal Tar</a></span>). It is a greenish-yellow fluorescent liquid, usually
containing phenol, cresol, naphthalene, anthracene, pyridine,
quinoline, acridine and other substances. Its chief use is for the
preservation of timber.</p>

<p><i>Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</i>&mdash;Creosote derived from wood-tar
is given medicinally in doses of from one to five minims, either
suspended in mucilage, or in capsules. It should always be
administered after a meal, when the gastric contents dilute it
and prevent irritation. Creosote and carbolic acid (<i>q.v.</i>) have a
very similar pharmacology; but there is one conspicuous exception.
Beech-wood creosote alone should be used in medicine,
as its composition renders it much more valuable than other
creosotes. Its constituents circulate unchanged in the blood
and are excreted by the lungs. Although carbolic acid has no
value in phthisis (pulmonary tuberculosis) or in any other
bacterial condition of the lungs, creosote, having volatile constituents
which are excreted in the expired air and which are
powerfully antiseptic, may well be of much value in these conditions.
In phthisis creosote is now superseded by both its
carbonate (creosotal)&mdash;given in the same doses&mdash;which causes
less gastric disturbance, and by guaiacol itself, which may be
given in doses up to thirty minims in capsules. The phosphate
(phosote or phosphote), phosphite (phosphotal), and valerianate
(eosote) also find application. Similarly the carbonate of guaiacol
may be given in doses even as large as a drachm. Creosote may
also be used as an inhalation with a steam atomizer. It is applicable
not only in phthisis but in bronchiectasis, bronchitis,
broncho-pneumonia, lobar pneumonia and all other bacterial
lung diseases. Like carbolic acid, creosote may be used in
toothache, and the local antiseptic and anaesthetic action which
it shares with that substance is often of value in relieving gastric
pain due to simple ulcer or cancer, and in those forms of vomiting
which are due to gastric irritation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÉQUY,<a name="ar223" id="ar223"></a></span> a French family which originated in Picardy, and
took its name from a small lordship in the present Pas-de-Calais.
Its genealogy goes back to the 10th century, and from it originated
the noble houses of Blécourt, Canaples, Heilly and Royon.
Henri de Créquy was killed at the siege of Damietta in 1240;
Jacques de Créquy, marshal of Guienne, was killed at Agincourt
with his brothers Jean and Raoul; Jean de Créquy, lord of
Canaples, was in the Burgundian service, and took part in the
defence of Paris against Joan of Arc in 1429, received the order
of the Golden Fleece in 1431, and was ambassador to Aragon
and France; Antoine de Créquy was one of the boldest captains
of Francis I., and died in consequence of an accident at the siege
of Hesdin in 1523. Jean VIII., sire de Créquy, prince de Poix,
seigneur de Canaples (d. 1555), left three sons, the eldest of whom,
Antoine de Créquy (1535-1574), inherited the family estates on
the death of his brothers at St Quentin in 1557. He was raised
to the cardinalate, and his nephew and heir, Antoine de Blanchefort,
assumed the name and arms of Créquy.</p>

<p>Charles I. de Blanchefort, marquis de Créquy, prince de Poix,
duc de Lesdiguières (1578-1638), marshal of France, son of the
last-named, saw his first fighting before Laon in 1594, and was
wounded at the capture of Saint Jean d&rsquo;Angély in 1621. In
the next year he became a marshal of France. He served through
the Piedmontese campaign in aid of Savoy in 1624 as second in
command to the constable, François de Bonne, duc de Lesdiguières,
whose daughter Madeleine he had married in 1595. He
inherited in 1626 the estates and title of his father-in-law, who
had induced him, after the death of his first wife, to marry
her half-sister Françoise. He was also lieutenant-general of
Dauphiné. In 1633 he was ambassador to Rome, and in 1636
to Venice. He fought in the Italian campaigns of 1630, 1635,
1636 and 1637, when he helped to defeat the Spaniards at
Monte Baldo. He was killed on the 17th of March 1638 in an
attempt to raise the siege of Crema, a fortress in the Milanese.
He had a quarrel extending over years with Philip, the bastard of
Savoy, which ended in a duel fatal to Philip in 1599; and in 1620
he defended Saint-Aignan, who was his prisoner of war, against
a prosecution threatened by Louis XIII. Some of his letters
are preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, and his
life was written by N. Chorier (Grenoble, 1683).</p>

<p>His eldest son, François, comte de Sault, due de Lesdiguières
(1600-1677), governor and lieutenant-general of Dauphiné,
took the name and arms of Bonne. The younger, Charles II.
de Créquy, seigneur de Canaples, was killed at the siege of
Chambéry in 1630, leaving three sons&mdash;Charles III., sieur de
Blanchefort, prince de Poix, duc de Créquy (1623?-1687);
Alphonse de Créquy, comte de Canaples (d. 1711), who became
on the extinction of the elder branch of the family in 1702
duc de Lesdiguières, and eventually succeeded also to his younger
brother&rsquo;s honours; and François, chevalier de Créquy and
marquis de Marines, marshal of France (1625-1687).</p>

<p>The last-named was born in 1625, and as a boy took part in
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, distinguishing himself so greatly that
at the age of twenty-six he was made a <i>maréchal de camp</i>, and
a lieutenant-general before he was thirty. He was regarded
as the most brilliant of the younger officers, and won the favour
of Louis XIV. by his fidelity to the court during the second
Fronde. In 1667 he served on the Rhine, and in 1668 he commanded
the covering army during Louis XIV.&rsquo;s siege of Lille,
after the surrender of which the king rewarded him with the
marshalate. In 1670 he overran the duchy of Lorraine. Shortly
after this Turenne, his old commander, was made marshal-general,
and all the marshals were placed under his orders. Many resented
this, and Créquy, in particular, whose career of uninterrupted
success had made him over-confident, went into exile
rather than serve under Turenne. After the death of Turenne
and the retirement of Condé, he became the most important
general officer in the army, but his over-confidence was punished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
by the severe defeat of Conzer Brück (1675) and the surrender of
Trier and his own captivity which followed. But in the later
campaigns of this war (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dutch Wars</a></span>) he showed himself
again a cool, daring and successful commander, and, carrying on
the tradition of Turenne and Condé, he was in his turn the
pattern of the younger generals of the stamp of Luxembourg
and Villars. He died in Paris on the 3rd of February 1687.</p>

<p>Alphonse de Créquy had not the talent of his brothers, and
lost his various appointments in France. He went to London in
1672, where he became closely allied with Saint Évremond,
and was one of the intimates of King Charles II.</p>

<p>Charles III. de Créquy served in the campaigns of 1642 and
1645 in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and in Catalonia in 1649. In 1646,
after the siege of Orbitello, he was made lieutenant-general by
Louis. By faithful service during the king&rsquo;s minority he had won
the gratitude of Anne of Austria and of Mazarin, and in 1652 he
became duc de Créquy and a peer of France. The latter half of
his life was spent at court, where he held the office of first gentleman
of the royal chamber, which had been bought for him by
his grandfather. In 1659 he was sent to Spain with gifts for the
infanta Maria Theresa, and on a similar errand to Bavaria in
1680 before the marriage of the dauphin. He was ambassador
to Rome from 1662 to 1665, and to England in 1677; and became
governor of Paris in 1675. He died in Paris on the 13th of
February 1687. His only daughter, Madeleine, married Charles
de la Trémoille (1655-1709).</p>

<p>The marshal François de Créquy had two sons, whose brilliant
military abilities bade fair to rival his own. The elder, François
Joseph, marquis de Créquy (1662-1702), already held the grade
of lieutenant-general when he was killed at Luzzara on the
13th of August 1702; and Nicolas Charles, sire de Créquy, was
killed before Tournai in 1696 at the age of twenty-seven.</p>

<p>A younger branch of the Créquy family, that of Hémont, was
represented by Louis Marie, marquis de Créquy (1705-1741),
author of the <i>Principes philosophiques des saints solitaires
d&rsquo;Égypte</i> (1779), and husband of the marquise separately noticed
below, and became extinct with the death in 1801 of his son,
Charles Marie, who had some military reputation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRÉQUY, RENÉE CAROLINE DE FROULLAY,<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquise de</span>
(1714-1803), was born on the 19th of October 1714, at the château
of Monfleaux (Mayenne), the daughter of Lieutenant-General
Charles François de Froullay. She was educated by her maternal
grandmother, and married in 1737 Louis Marie, marquis de
Créquy (see above), who died four years after the marriage.
Madame de Créquy devoted herself to the care of her only son,
who rewarded her with an ingratitude which was the chief
sorrow of her life. In 1755 she began to receive in Paris, among
her intimates being D&rsquo;Alembert and J. J. Rousseau. She had
none of the frivolity generally associated with the women of her
time and class, and presently became extremely religious with
inclinations to Jansenism. D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s visits ceased when she
adopted religion, and she was nearly seventy when she formed
the great friendship of her life with Sénac de Meilhan, whom she
met in 1781, and with whom she carried on a correspondence
(edited by Édouard Fournier, with a preface by Sainte-Beuve
in 1856). She commented on and criticized Meilhan&rsquo;s works and
helped his reputation. She was arrested in 1793 and imprisoned
in the convent of Les Oiseaux until the fall of Robespierre
(July 1794). The well-known <i>Souvenirs de la marquise de
Créquy</i> (1710-1803), printed in 7 volumes, 1834-1835, and
purporting to be addressed to her grandson, Tancrède de Créquy,
was the production of a Breton adventurer, Cousin de Courchamps.

were severely criticized in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

philosopher. His work, <i>The Light of the Lord</i> (<i>&rsquo;Or &rsquo;Adonai</i>),
deeply affected Spinoza, and thus his philosophy became of
wide importance. Maimonides (<i>q.v.</i>) had brought Jewish thought
entirely under the domination of Aristotle. The work of Crescas,
though it had no immediate success, ended in effecting its liberation.
He refused to base Judaism on speculative philosophy
alone; there was a deep emotional side to his thought. Thus he
based Judaism on love, not on knowledge; love was the bond
between God and man, and man&rsquo;s fundamental duty was love as
expressed in obedience to God&rsquo;s will. Spinoza derived from
Crescas his distinction between attributes and properties; he
shared Crescas&rsquo;s views on creation and free will, and in the whole
trend of his thought the influence of Crescas is strongly marked.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRESCENT<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> (Lat. <i>crescens</i>, growing), originally the waxing
moon, hence a name applied to the shape of the moon in its first
quarter. The crescent is employed as a charge in heraldry, with
its horns vertical; when they are turned to the dexter side of the
shield, it is called increscent, when to the sinister, decrescent.
A crescent is used as a difference to denote the second son of a
house; thus the earls of Harrington place a crescent upon a
crescent, as descending from the second son of a second son.
An order of the crescent was instituted by Charles I. of Naples
and Sicily in 1268, and revived by René of Anjou in 1464. A
Turkish order or decoration of the crescent was instituted by
Sultan Selim III. in 1799, in memory of the diamond crescent
which he had presented to Nelson after the battle of the Nile, and
which Nelson wore on his coat as if it were an order.</p>

<p>The crescent is the military and religious symbol of the
Ottoman Turks. According to the story told by Hesychius
of Miletus, during the siege of Byzantium by Philip of Macedon
the moon suddenly appeared, the dogs began to bark and
aroused the inhabitants, who were thus enabled to frustrate
the enemy&rsquo;s scheme of undermining the walls. The grateful
Byzantines erected a statue to &ldquo;torch-bearing&rdquo; Hecate, and
adopted the lunar crescent as the badge of the city. It is generally
supposed that it was in turn adopted by the Turks after the
capture of Constantinople in 1453, either as a badge of triumph,
or to commemorate a partial eclipse of the moon on the night of
the final attack. In reality, it seems to have been used by them
long before that event. Ala ud-din, the Seljuk sultan of Iconium
(1245-1254), and Ertoghrul, his lieutenant and the founder of
the Ottoman branch of the Turkish race, assumed it as a device,
and it appeared on the standard of the janissaries of Sultan
Orkhan (1326-1360). Since the new moon is associated with
special acts of devotion in Turkey&mdash;where, as in England, there
is a popular superstition that it is unlucky to see it through glass&mdash;it
may originally have been adopted in consequence of its religious
significance. According to Professor Ridgeway, however,
the Turkish crescent, like that seen on modern horse-trappings,
has nothing to do with the new moon, but is the result of the base-to-base
conjunction of two claw or tusk amulets, an example of
which has been brought to light during the excavations of the
site of the temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta (see <i>Athenaeum</i>,
March 21, 1908). There is nothing distinctively Turkish in
the combination of crescent and star which appears on the
Turkish national standard; the latter is shown by coins and
inscriptions to have been an ancient Illyrian symbol, and is of
course common in knightly and decorative orders. It is doubtful
whether any opposition between crescent and cross, as symbols
of Islam and Christianity, was ever intended by the Turks; and
it is an historical error to attribute the crescent to the Saracens

<p><span class="bold">CRESCIMBENI, GIOVANNI MARIO<a name="ar227" id="ar227"></a></span> (1663-1728), Italian
critic and poet, was born at Macerata in 1663. Having been
educated by a French priest at Rome, he entered the Jesuits&rsquo;
college of his native town, where he produced a tragedy on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
story of Darius, and versified the <i>Pharsalia</i>. In 1679 he received
the degree of doctor of laws, and in 1680 he removed again to
Rome. The study of Filicaja and Leonico having convinced
him that he and all his contemporaries were working in a wrong
direction, he resolved to attempt a general reform. In 1690,
in conjunction with fourteen others, he founded the celebrated
academy of the Arcadians, and began the contest against false
taste and its adherents. The academy was most successful;
branch societies were opened in all the principal cities of Italy;
and the influence of Marini, opposed by the simplicity and elegance
of such models as Costanzo, soon died away. Crescimbeni
officiated as secretary to the Arcadians for thirty-eight years.
In 1705 he was made canon of Santa Maria; in 1715 he obtained
the chief curacy attached to the same church; and about two
months before he died (1728) he was admitted a member of the
order of Jesus.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His principal work is the <i>Istoria della volgar poesia</i> (Rome, 1698),
an estimate of all the poets of Italy, past and contemporary, which
may yet be consulted with advantage. The most important of his
numerous other publications are the <i>Commentarij</i> (5 vols., Rome,
1702-1711), and <i>La Bellezza della volgar poezia</i> (Rome, 1700).</p>

about 450 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> As his amazon was wounded (<i>volnerata</i>; Pliny,
<i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxxiv. 75), we may safely identify it with the figure,
of which several copies are extant, who is carefully removing
her blood-stained garment from a wound under the right breast.
Another work of Cresilas of which copies survive is the portrait
of Pericles, the earliest Greek portrait which has been with
certainty identified, and which fully confirms the statement
of ancient critics that Cresilas was an artist who idealized and
added nobility to men of noble type. An extant portrait of
Anacreon is also derived from Cresilas.</p>

The three isomeric cresols are found in the tar obtained in the
destructive distillation of coal, beech-wood and pine. The crude
cresol obtained from tar cannot be separated into its different
constituents by fractional distillation, since the boiling points of
the three isomers are very close together. The pure substances
are best obtained by fusion of the corresponding toluene sulphonic
acids with potash.</p>

<p>Ortho-cresol, CH<span class="su">3</span>(1)·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·OH(2), occurs as sulphate in the
urine of the horse. It may be prepared by fusion of ortho-toluene
sulphonic acid with potash; by the action of phosphorus pentoxide
on carvacrol; or by the action of zinc chloride on camphor.
It is a crystalline solid, which melts at 30° C. and boils at 190.8°
C. Fusion with alkalis converts it into salicylic acid.</p>

<p>Meta-cresol, CH<span class="su">3</span>(1)·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·OH(3), is formed when thymol
(para-isopropyl-meta-cresol)
is heated with phosphorus pentoxide.
Propylene is liberated during the reaction, and the phosphoric
acid ester of meta-cresol which is formed is then fused with
potash. It can also be prepared by distilling meta-oxyuvitic acid
with lime, or by the action of air on boiling toluene in the presence
of aluminium chloride (C. Friedel and J. M. Crafts, <i>Ann. Chim.
Phys.</i>, 1888 [6], 14, p. 436). It solidifies in a freezing mixture, on
the addition of a crystal of phenol, and then melts at 3°-4° C.
It boils at 202°.8 C. Its aqueous solution is coloured bluish-violet
by ferric chloride.</p>

<p>Para-cresol, CH<span class="su">3</span>(1)·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·OH(4), occurs as sulphate in the

the putrefaction products of tyrosine. It may be prepared by the
fusion of para-toluene sulphonic acid with potash; by the action
of nitrous acid on para-toluidine; or by heating para-oxyphenyl
acetic acid with lime. It crystallizes in prisms which melt at
36° C. and boil at 201°.8 C. It is soluble in water, and the aqueous
solution gives a blue coloration with ferric chloride. When
treated with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate, no
chlorinated quinones are obtained (M. S. Southworth, <i>Ann.</i>
(1873), 168, p. 271), a behaviour which distinguishes it from
ortho- and meta-cresol.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESPI, DANIELE<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> (1590-1630), Italian historical painter,
was born near Milan, and studied under Giovanni Battista Crespi
and Giulio Procaccini. He was an excellent colourist; his
drawing was correct and vigorous, and he grouped his compositions
with much ability. His best work, a series of pictures from
the life of Saint Bruno, is in the monastery of the Carthusians
at Milan. Among the most famous of his paintings is a &ldquo;Stoning
of St Stephen&rdquo; at Brera, and there are several excellent examples
of his work in the city of his birth and at Pavia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESPI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar231" id="ar231"></a></span> (1557-1663), called Il Cerano,
Italian painter, sculptor, and architect, was born at Cerano in
the Milanese. He was a scholar of considerable attainments,
and held a position of dignity in his native city. He was head of
the Milanese Academy founded by Cardinal Frederigo Borromeo,
and he was the teacher of Guercino. He is most famous as a
painter; and, though his figures are neither natural nor graceful,
his colouring is good, and his designs full of ideal beauty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESPI, GIUSEPPE MARIA<a name="ar232" id="ar232"></a></span> (1665-1747), Italian painter,
called &ldquo;Lo Spagnuolo&rdquo; from his fondness for rich apparel,
was born at Bologna, and was trained under Angelo Toni,
Domenico Canuti and Carlo Cignani. He then went through
a course of copying from Correggio and Barocci; this he followed
up with a journey to Venice for the sake of Titian and Paul
Veronese; and late in life he proclaimed himself a follower of
Guercino and Pietro da Cortona. He was a good colourist and
a facile executant, and was wont to employ the camera obscura
with great success in the treatment of light and shadow; but
he was careless and unconscientious. He was a clever portrait-painter
and a brilliant caricaturist; and his etchings after
Rembrandt and Salvator are in some demand. His greatest
work, a &ldquo;Massacre of the Innocents,&rdquo; is at Bologna; but the
Dresden gallery possesses twelve examples of him, among which
is his celebrated series of the Seven Sacraments.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRESS,<a name="ar233" id="ar233"></a></span> in botany. &ldquo;Garden Cress&rdquo; (<i>Lepidium sativum</i>) is
an annual plant (nat. ord. Cruciferae), known as a cultivated
plant at the present day in Europe, North Africa, western Asia
and India, but its origin is obscure. Alphonse de Candolle
(<i>L&rsquo;Origine des plantes cultivées</i>) says its cultivation must date from
ancient times and be widely diffused, for very different names
for it exist in the Arab, Persian, Albanian, Hindustani and
Bengali tongues. He considered the plant to be of Persian
origin, whence it may have spread after the Sanskrit epoch
(there is no Sanskrit name for it) into the gardens of India,
Syria, Greece and North Africa. It is used in salads, the young
plants being cut and eaten while still in the seed-leaf, forming,
along with plants of the white mustard in the same stage of
growth, what is commonly called &ldquo;small salad.&rdquo; The seeds
should be sown thickly broadcast or in rows in succession every
ten or fourteen days, according to the demand. The sowings
may be made in the open ground from March till October, the
earliest under hand-glasses, and the summer ones in a cool
moist situation, where water from trees, shrubs, walls, &amp;c.,
cannot fall on or near them. The grit thrown up by falling
water pierces the tender tissues of the cress, and cannot be
thoroughly removed by washing. During winter they must be
raised on a slight hotbed, or in shallow boxes or pans placed
in any of the glass-houses where there is a temperature of 60°
or 65°. Cress is subject to the attack of a fungus (<i>Pythium debaryanum</i>)
if kept too close and moist. The pest very quickly
infects a whole sowing. There is no cure for it; preventive
measures should therefore be taken by keeping the sowings
fairly dry and well ventilated. The seed should be sown on new
soil, and should not be covered.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Golden&rdquo; or &ldquo;Australian&rdquo; cress is a dwarf, yellowish-green,
mild-flavoured sort, which is cut and eaten when a little
more advanced in growth but while still young and tender. It
should be sown at intervals of a month from March onwards, the
autumn sowing, for winter and spring use, being made in a
sheltered situation.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;curled&rdquo; or &ldquo;Normandy&rdquo; cress is a very hardy sort,
of good flavour. In this, which is allowed to grow like parsley,
the leaves are picked for use while young; and, being finely cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
and curled, they are well adapted for garnishing. It should be
sown thinly, in drills, in good soil in the open borders, in March,
April and May, and for winter and spring use at the foot of a south
wall early in September, and about the middle of October.</p>

<p><i>Water-cress.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Water-cress&rdquo; (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) is a
member of the same natural order, and a native of Great Britain.
Although now so largely used, it does not appear to have been
cultivated in England prior to the 19th century, though in
Germany, especially near Erfurt, it had been grown long previously.
Its flavour is due to an essential oil containing sulphur.
Water-cress is largely cultivated in shallow ditches, prepared
in wet, low-lying meadows, means being provided for flooding
the ditches at will. Where the amount of water available is
limited, the ditches are arranged at successively higher levels,
so as to allow of the volume admitted to the upper ditch being
passed successively to the others. The ditches are usually
puddled with clay, which is covered to the depth of 9 to 12 in.
with well-manured soil.</p>

<p>A stock of plants may be raised in two ways&mdash;by cuttings, and
by seeds. If a stock is to be raised from cuttings, the desired
quantity of young shoots is gathered&mdash;those sold in bunches for
salad serve the purpose well&mdash;and reduced where necessary to
about 3 in. in length, the basal and frequently rooted portion
being rejected. They are dibbled thickly into one of the ditches,
and only enough water admitted to just cover the soil. If the
start is made in late spring, the cuttings will be rooted in a week.
They are allowed to remain for another week or two, and are then
taken up and dropped about 9 in. apart into the other ditches,
which have been slightly flooded to receive them. There is no
need to plant them&mdash;the young roots will very soon be securely
anchored. The volume of water is increased as the plants grow.
If raised from seed, the seed-bed is prepared as for cuttings, and
seed sown either in drills or broadcast. No flooding is done until
the seedlings are up. Water is then admitted, the level being
raised as the plants grow. When 5 or 6 in. high, they are taken
up and dropped into their permanent quarters precisely like
those raised from cuttings.</p>

<p>Cultivated as above described, the plants afford frequent
cuttings of large clean cress of excellent flavour for market
purposes. Sooner or later growth will become less vigorous and
flowering shoots will be produced. This will be accompanied by
a pronounced deterioration of the remaining vegetative shoots.
These signs will be interpreted by the grower to mean that his
plants, as a market crop, are worn out. He will therefore take
steps to repeat the routine of culture above described. In the
winter the ditches are flooded to protect the cress from frost.</p>

<p>The best-flavoured water-cress is produced in the pure water of
running streams over chalk or gravel soil. Should the water be
contaminated by sewage or other undesirable matter, the plants
not only absorb some of the impurities but also serve to anchor
much of the solid particles washed as scum among them. This is
extremely difficult to dislodge by washing, and renders the cress a
source of danger as food.</p>

<p>Water-cress for domestic use may be raised as a kitchen-garden
crop if frequently watered overhead. Beds to afford cress during
the summer should be made in broad trenches on a border facing
north. It may also be raised in pots or pans stood in saucers of
water and frequently watered overhead.</p>

<p>In recent years in America attention has been paid to the
injury done to water-cress beds by the &ldquo;water-cress sow-bug&rdquo;
(<i>Mancasellus brachyurus</i>), and the &ldquo;water-cress leaf-beetle&rdquo;
(<i>Phaedon aeruginosa</i>). Another species of <i>Phaedon</i> is known in
England as &ldquo;blue beetle&rdquo; or &ldquo;mustard beetle,&rdquo; and is a pest
also of mustard, cabbage and kohlrabi (see F. H. Chittenden, in
<i>Bulletin</i> 66, part ii. of Bureau of Entomology, United States
Department of Agriculture, 1907).</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;nasturtium&rdquo; is applied in gardens, but incorrectly,
to species of <i>Tropaeolum</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRESSENT, CHARLES<a name="ar234" id="ar234"></a></span> (1685-1768), French furniture-maker,
sculptor and <i>fondeur-ciseleur</i>. As the second son of François
Cressent, <i>sculpteur du roi</i>, and grandson of Charles Cressent, a
furniture-maker of Amiens, who also became a sculptor, he
inherited the tastes and aptitudes which were likely to make a
finished designer and craftsman. Even more important perhaps
was the fact that he was a pupil of André Charles Boulle.
Trained in such surroundings, it is not surprising that he should
have reached a degree of achievement which has to a great
extent justified the claim that he was the best decorative artist
of the 18th century. Cressent&rsquo;s distinction is closely connected
with the regency, but his earlier work had affinities with the
school of Boulle, while his later pieces were full of originality.
He was an artist in the widest sense of the word. He not
only designed and made furniture, but created the magnificent
gilded enrichments which are so characteristic of his work. He
was likewise a sculptor, and among his plastic work is known
to have been a bronze bust of Louis, duc d&rsquo;Orléans, the son
of the regent, for whom Cressent had made one of the finest
examples of French furniture of the 18th century&mdash;the famous
<i>médaillier</i> now in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Cressent&rsquo;s bronze
mounts were executed with a sharpness of finish and a grace and
vigour of outline which were hardly excelled by his great contemporary
Jacques Caffieri. His female figures placed at the
corners of tables are indeed among the most delicious achievements
of the great days of the French metal worker. Much of
Cressent&rsquo;s work survives, and can be identified; the Louvre and
the Wallace collection are especially rich in it, and his commode
at Hertford House with gilt handles representing Chinese dragons
is perhaps the most elaborate piece he ever produced. The work
of identification is rendered comparatively easy in his case by the
fact that he published catalogues of three sales of his work. These
catalogues are highly characteristic of the man, who shared in no
small degree the personal <i>bravoura</i> of Cellini, and could sometimes
execute almost as well. He did not hesitate to describe himself
as the author of &ldquo;a clock worthy to be placed in the very finest
cabinets,&rdquo; &ldquo;the most distinguished bronzes,&rdquo; or pieces of &ldquo;the
most elegant form adorned with bronzes of extra richness.&rdquo; He
worked much in marqueterie, both in tortoiseshell and in brilliant
coloured woods. He was indeed an artist to whom colour
appealed with especial force. The very type and exemplar of
the &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; of the regency, he is worthy to have given his own
name to some of the fashions which he deduced from it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESSWELL, SIR CRESSWELL<a name="ar235" id="ar235"></a></span> (1794-1863), English judge,
was a descendant of an old Northumberland family, and was born
at Newcastle in 1794. He was educated at the Charterhouse and
at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1814,
and M.A. four years later. Having chosen the profession of the
law he studied at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in
1819. He joined the northern circuit, and was not long in earning
a distinguished position among his professional brethren. In 1837
he entered parliament as Conservative member for Liverpool,
and he soon gained a reputation as an acute and learned debater
on all constitutional questions. In January 1842 he was made a
judge of the court of common pleas, being knighted at the same
time; and this post he occupied for sixteen years. When the
new court for probate, divorce and matrimonial causes was
established (1858), Sir Cresswell Cresswell was requested by the
Liberal government to become its first judge and undertake the
arduous task of its organization. Although he had already
earned a right to retire, and possessed large private wealth,
he accepted this new task, and during the rest of his life devoted
himself to it most assiduously and conscientiously, with complete
satisfaction to the public. In one case only, out of the very large
number on which he pronounced judgment, was his decision
reversed. His death was sudden. By a fall from his horse on the
11th of July 1863 his knee-cap was injured. He was recovering
from this when on the 29th of the same month he died of disease
of the heart.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESSY, HUGH PAULINUS DE<a name="ar236" id="ar236"></a></span> (c. 1605-1674), English Benedictine
monk, whose religious name was Serenus, was born at
Wakefield, Yorkshire, about 1605. He went to Oxford at the
age of fourteen, and in 1626 became a fellow of Merton College.
Having taken orders, he rose to the dignity of dean of Leighlin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
Ireland, and canon of Windsor. He also acted as chaplain to Lord
Wentworth, afterwards the celebrated earl of Strafford. For some
time he travelled abroad as tutor to Lord Falmouth, and in 1646,
during a visit to Rome, joined the Roman Catholic Church. In
the following year he published his <i>Exomologesis</i> (Paris, 1647), or
account of his conversion, which was highly valued by Roman
Catholics as an answer to William Chillingworth&rsquo;s attacks.
Cressy entered the Benedictine Order in 1649, and for four years
resided at Somerset House as chaplain to Catherine of Braganza,
wife of Charles II. He died at West Grinstead on the 10th
of August 1674. Cressy&rsquo;s chief work, <i>The Church History of
Brittanny or England, from the beginning of Christianity to the
Norman Conquest</i> (1st vol. only published, Rouen, 1668), gives an
exhaustive account of the foundation of monasteries during the
Saxon heptarchy, and asserts that they followed the Benedictine
rule, differing in this respect from many historians. The work
was much criticized by Lord Clarendon, but defended by Antony
à Wood in his <i>Athenae Oxoniensis</i>, who supports Cressy&rsquo;s statement
that it was compiled from original MSS. and from the
<i>Annales Ecclesiae Britannicae</i> of Michael Alford, <i>Dugdale&rsquo;s
Monasticon</i>, and the <i>Decem Scriptores Historiae Anglicanae</i>. The
second part of the history, which has never been printed, was
discovered at Douai in 1856. To Roman Catholics Cressy&rsquo;s name
is familiar as the editor of Walter Hilton&rsquo;s <i>Scale of Perfection</i>
(London, 1659); of Father A. Baker&rsquo;s <i>Sancta Sophia</i> (2 vols.,
Douai, 1657); and of Juliana of Norwich&rsquo;s <i>Sixteen Revelations
on the Love of God</i> (1670). These books, which would have been
lost but for Cressy&rsquo;s zeal, have been frequently reprinted, and
have been favourably regarded by a section of the Anglican
Church.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRESWICK, THOMAS<a name="ar240" id="ar240"></a></span> (1811-1869), English landscape-painter,
was born at Sheffield, and educated at Hazelwood, near Birmingham.
At Birmingham he first began to paint. His earliest
appearance as an exhibitor was in 1827, at the Society of British
Artists in London; in the ensuing year he sent to the Royal
Academy the two pictures named &ldquo;Llyn Gwynant, Morning,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Carnarvon Castle.&rdquo; About the same time he settled in
London; and in 1836 he took a house in Bayswater. He soon
attracted some attention as a landscape-painter, and had a
career of uniform and encouraging, though not signal success.
In 1842 he was elected an associate, and in 1850 a full member
of the Royal Academy, which, for several years before his death,
numbered hardly any other full members representing this branch
of art. In his early practice he set an example, then too much
needed, of diligent study of nature out of doors, painting on the
spot all the substantial part of several of his pictures. English
and Welsh streams may be said to have formed his favourite
subjects, and generally British rural scenery, mostly under its
cheerful, calm and pleasurable aspects, in open daylight. This
he rendered with elegant and equable skill, colour rather grey in
tint, especially in his later years, and more than average technical
accomplishment; his works have little to excite, but would, in
most conditions of public taste, retain their power to attract.
Creswick was industrious and extremely prolific; he produced,
besides a steady outpouring of paintings, numerous illustrations
for books. He was personally genial&mdash;a dark, bulky man,
somewhat heavy and graceless in aspect in his later years. He
died at his house in Bayswater, Linden Grove, on the 28th of
December 1869, after a few years of declining health. Among
his principal works may be named &ldquo;England&rdquo; (1847); &ldquo;Home
by the Sands, and a Squally Day&rdquo; (1848); &ldquo;Passing
Showers&rdquo; (1849); &ldquo;The Wind on Shore, a First Glimpse of the
Sea, and Old Trees&rdquo; (1850); &ldquo;A Mountain Lake, Moonrise&rdquo;
(1852); &ldquo;Changeable Weather&rdquo; (1865); also the &ldquo;London
Road, a Hundred Years ago&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Weald of Kent&rdquo;; the
&ldquo;Valley Mill&rdquo; (a Cornish subject); a &ldquo;Shady Glen&rdquo;; the
&ldquo;Windings of a River&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Shade of the Beech Trees&rdquo;;
the &ldquo;Course of the Greta&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Wharfe&rdquo;; &ldquo;Glendalough,&rdquo;
and other Irish subjects, 1836 to 1840; the &ldquo;Forest Farm.&rdquo;
Frith for figures, and Ansdell for animals, occasionally worked in

<p><span class="bold">CRETACEOUS SYSTEM,<a name="ar242" id="ar242"></a></span> in geology, the group of stratified
rocks which normally occupy a position above the Jurassic
system and below the oldest Tertiary deposits; therefore it is
in this system that the closing records of the great Mesozoic era
are to be found. The name furnishes an excellent illustration of
the inconvenience of employing a local lithological feature in
the descriptive title of a wide-ranging rock-system. The white
chalk (Lat. <i>creta</i>), which gives its name to the system, was first
studied in the Anglo-Parisian basin, where it takes a prominent
place; but even in this limited area there is a considerable
thickness and variety of rocks which are not chalky, and the
Cretaceous system as a whole contains a remarkable diversity
of types of sediment.</p>

<p><i>Classification.</i>&mdash;The earlier subdivisions of the Cretaceous rocks
were founded upon the uncertain ground of similarity in lithological
characters, assisted by observed stratigraphical sequence.
This method yielded poor results even in a circumscribed area like
Great Britain, and it breaks down utterly when applied to the
correlation of rocks of similar age in Europe and elsewhere.
Study of the fossils, however, has elicited the fact that certain
forms characterize certain &ldquo;zones,&rdquo; which are preceded and
succeeded by other zones each bearing a peculiar species or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
distinctive assemblage of species. By these means the Cretaceous
rocks of the world have now been correlated zone with zone,
with a degree of exactitude proportional to the palaeontological
information gained in the several areas of occurrence.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous system falls naturally into two divisions,
an upper and a lower, in all but a few limited regions. In the
table on page 288 the names of the principal stages are
enumerated; these are capable of world-wide application.
The sub-stages are of more local value, and too much importance
must not be attached to them for the correlation of distant
deposits. The general table is designed to show the relative
position in the system of some of the more important and better-known
formations; but it must be remembered that the Cretaceous
rocks of Europe can now be classified in considerable detail
by their fossils, the most accurate group for this purpose being
the cephalopods. The smaller table was compiled by T. C.
Chamberlin and R. D. Salisbury to show the main subdivisions
of the North American Cretaceous rocks. The correlation of the
minor subdivisions of Europe and America are only approximate.</p>

<p><i>Relation of the Cretaceous Strata to the Systems above and below.</i>&mdash;In
central and northern Europe the boundary between the
Cretaceous and Tertiary strata is sharply defined by a fairly
general unconformity, except in the Danian and Montian beds,
where there is a certain commingling of Tertiary with Cretaceous
fossils. The relations with the underlying Jurassic rocks are not
so clearly defined, partly because the earliest Cretaceous rocks are
obscured by too great a thickness of younger strata, and partly
because the lowest observable rocks of the system are not the
oldest, but are higher members of the system that have overlapped
on to much older rocks. However, in the south of England,
in the Alpine area, and in part of N.W. Germany the passage from
Jurassic to Cretaceous is so gradual that there is some divergence
of opinion as to the best position for the line of separation.
In the Alpine region this passage is formed by marine beds, in
the other two by brackish-water deposits. In a like manner
the Potomac beds of N. America grade downwards into the
Jurassic; while in the Laramie formation an upward passage is
observed into the Eocene deposits. There is a very general
unconformity and break between the Lower and Upper Cretaceous;
this has led Chamberlin and Salisbury to suggest that the
Lower Cretaceous should be regarded as a separate period with
the title &ldquo;Comanchean.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Physiographical Conditions and Types of Deposit.</i>&mdash;With the
opening of the Cretaceous in Europe there commenced a period
of marine transgression; in the central and western European
region this took place from the S. towards the N., slow at first and
local in effect, but becoming more decided at the beginning of
the upper division. During the earlier portion of the period, S.
England, Belgium and Hanover were covered by a great series of
estuarine sands and clays, termed the Wealden formation (<i>q.v.</i>),
the delta of a large river or rivers flowing probably from the N.W.
Meanwhile, in the rest of Europe alternations of marine and
estuarine deposits were being laid down; but over the Alpine
region lay the open sea, where there flourished coral reefs and
great banks of clam-like molluscs. The sea gradually encroached
upon the estuarine Wealden area, and at the time of the Aptian
deposits uniform marine conditions prevailed from western
Europe through Russia into Asia. This extension of the sea is
illustrated in England by the overlap of the Gault over the
Lower Greens and on to the older rocks, and by similar occurrences
in N. France and Germany.</p>

<p>Almost throughout the Upper Cretaceous period the marine
invasion continued, varied here and there by slight movements
in the opposite sense which did not, however, interfere with the
quiet general advance of the sea. This marine extension made
itself felt over the old central plateau of France, the N. of Great
Britain, the Spanish peninsula, the Armorican peninsula, and
also in the Bavarian Jura and Bohemia; it affected the northern
part of Africa and East Africa; in N. America the sea spread
over the entire length of the Rocky Mountain region; and in
Brazil, eastern Asia and western Australia, Upper Cretaceous
deposits are found resting directly upon much older rocks.
Indeed, at this time there happened one of the greatest changes
in the distribution of land and water that have been recorded
in geological history.</p>

<p>We have seen that in early Cretaceous times marine limestones
were being formed in southern Europe, while estuarine sands and
muds were being laid down in the Anglo-German delta, and that
beds of intermediate character were being made in parts of N.
France and Germany. During later Cretaceous times this striking
difference between the northern and southern facies was maintained,
notwithstanding the fact that the later deposits were of
marine origin in both regions. In the northern region the gradual
deepening and accompanying extension of the sea caused the
sandy deposits to become finer grained in N.W. Europe. The
sandy beds and clays then gave way to marly deposits, and in
these early stages glauconitic grains are very characteristically
present both in the sand and in the marls. In their turn these
marly deposits in the Anglo-Parisian basin were succeeded
gradually and somewhat intermittently by the purer, soft limestone
of the chalk sea, and by limestones, similar in character, in
N. France, extra-Alpine Germany, S. Scandinavia, Denmark and
Russia. Meanwhile, the S. European deposits maintained the
characters already indicated; limestones (not chalk) prevailed,
except in certain Alpine and Carpathian tracts where detrital
sandstones were being laid down.</p>

<p>The great difference between the lithological characters of the
northern and southern deposits is accompanied by an equally
striking difference between their respective organic contents. In
the north, the genera <i>Inoceramus</i> and <i>Belemnitella</i> are particularly
abundant. In the south, the remarkable, large, clam-like,
aberrant pelecypods, the <i>Hippuritidae</i>, <i>Rudistes</i>, <i>Caprotina</i>, &amp;c.,
attained an extraordinary development; they form great
lenticular banks, like the clam banks of warm seas, or like our
modern oyster-beds; they appear in successive species in the
different stages of the Cretaceous system of the south, and can be
used for marking palaeontological horizons as the cephalopods
are used elsewhere. Certain genera of ammonites, <i>Haploceras</i>,
<i>Lytoceras</i>, <i>Phylloceras</i>, rare in the north, are common in the
south; and the southern facies is further characterized by the
peculiar group of swollen belemnites (<i>Dumontia</i>), by the gasteropods
<i>Actionella</i>, <i>Nerinea</i>, &amp;c., and by reef-building corals. The
southern facies is far more widespread and typical of the period
than is the chalk; it not only covers all southern Europe, but
spreads eastwards far into Asia and round the Mediterranean
basin into Africa. It is found again in Texas, Alabama, Mexico,
the West Indies and Colombia; though limestones of the chalk
type are found in Texas, New Zealand, and locally in one or two
other places. The marine deposits are organically formed
limestones, in which foraminifera and large bivalve mollusca
play a leading part, marls and sandstones; dolomite and oolitic
and pisolitic limestones are also known.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous seas were probably comparatively shallow;
this was certainly the case where the deposits are sandy, and in
the regions occupied by the hippuritic fauna. Much discussion
has taken place as to the depth of the chalk sea. Stress has been
laid upon the resemblance of this deposit to the modern deep-sea
globigerina-ooze; but on the whole the evidence is in favour of
moderate depth, perhaps not more than 1000 fathoms; the
freedom of the deposit from detrital matter being regarded as due
to the low elevation of the surrounding land, and the main lines of
drainage being in other directions. Sandy and shore deposits are
common throughout the system in every region. Besides the
Weald, there were great lacustrine and terrestrial deposits in
N. America (the Potomac, Kootenay, Morrison, Dakota and
Laramie formations) as well as in N. Spain, and in parts of
Germany, &amp;c. The general distribution of land and sea is indicated
in the map.</p>

<p><i>Earth Movements and Vulcanicity.</i>&mdash;During the greater part of
the Cretaceous period crustal movements had been small and
local in effect, but towards the close a series of great deformative
movements was inaugurated and continued into the next period.
These movements make it possible to discriminate between the
Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, because the conditions of sedimentation
were profoundly modified by them, and in most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
parts of the world there resulted a distinct break in the sequence
of fossil remains. Great tracts of our modern continental land
areas gradually emerged, and several mountainous tracts began
to be elevated, such as the Appalachians, parts of the Cordilleras,
and the Rocky Mountains, and their northern continuation, and
indeed the greater part of the western N. American continent was
intensely affected; the uplifting was associated with extensive
faulting. Volcanic activity was in abeyance in Europe and in
much of Asia, but in America there were many eruptions and
intrusions of igneous rock towards the close of the period.
Diabases and peridotites had been formed during the Lower
Cretaceous in the San Luis Obispo region. Great masses of ash
and conglomerate occur in the Crow&rsquo;s Nest Pass in Canada;
porphyries and porphyritic tuffs of later Cretaceous age are
important in the Andes; while similar rocks are found in the
Lower Cretaceous of New Zealand. It is, however, in the Deccan
lava flows of India that we find eruptions on a scale more vast
than any that have been recorded either before or since. These
outpourings of lava cover 200,000 sq. m. and are from 4000 to
6000 ft. thick. They lie upon an eroded Cenomanian surface and
are to some extent interbedded with Upper Cretaceous sediments.</p>

<p><i>Economic Products of Cretaceous Rocks.</i>&mdash;Coal is one of the
most important products of the rocks of this system. The
principal Cretaceous coal-bearing area is in the western interior
of N. America, where an enormous amount of coal&mdash;mostly
lignitic, but in places converted into anthracite&mdash;lies in the rocks
at the foot of the Rocky Mountains; most of this is of Laramie
age. Similar beds occur locally in Montana. Coal seams of Lower
Cretaceous age are found in the Black Hills (S. Dakota), Alaska,
Greenland, and in New Zealand; and the &ldquo;Upper Quader&rdquo; of
Löwenberg in Silesia also contains coal seams. Coals also occur
in the brackish and fresh-water deposits of Carinthia, Dalmatia
and Istria, while unimportant lignitic beds are known in many
other regions. The Fort Pierre beds are oil-bearing at Boulder,
Colorado; and the Trinity formation bears asphalt and bitumen.
Important clay deposits are worked in the Raritan formation of
New Jersey, &amp;c., and pottery clays are found in the Löwenberg
district in Germany. The Washita beds yield the well-known
hone stone. Great beds of gypsum exist in the Cretaceous rocks
of S. America. Near Salzburg a variety of the hippuritic limestone
is quarried for marble. Lithographic stone occurs in the
Pyrenees. The economic products peculiar to the chalk are
mentioned in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chalk</a></span>. Beds of iron ore are found in the
Lower Cretaceous of Germany and England.</p>

<p><i>The Life of the Cretaceous Period.</i>&mdash;The fossils from the
Cretaceous series comprise marine, fresh-water and terrestrial
animals and plants. Foremost in interest and importance is the
appearance in the Lower Potomac (Lower Cretaceous) of eastern
and central N. America of the earliest representatives of angiospermous
dicotyledons, and undoubted monocotyledons, the
progenitors of our modern flowering plants. The angiosperms
spread outward from the Atlantic coast region of N. America, and
first appeared in Europe in the Aptian of Portugal; towards the
close of the Lower Cretaceous period they occupied parts of
Greenland, the remaining land areas of N. America, and were
steadily advancing in every quarter of the globe. At first the
Jurassic plants, the Cycads, ferns and conifers, lived on and
were the dominant plant forms. Gradually, however, they took a
subordinate place, and by the close of the Cretaceous period the
angiosperms had gained the upper hand. The earliest of these
fossil angiosperms is not in a true sense a primitive form, and no
records of such types have yet been discovered. Some of the
early forms of the Lower Cretaceous are distinctly similar to
modern genera, such as <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Sassafras</i> and <i>Aralia</i>; others
bore leaves closely resembling our elm, maple, willow, oak,
eucalyptus, &amp;c. Before the close of the period many other
representatives of living genera had appeared, beech, walnut,
tamarisk, plane, laurel (<i>Laurus</i>), cinnamon, ivy, ilex, viburnum,
buckthorn, breadfruit, oleander and others; there were also
junipers, thujas, pines and sequoias and monocotyledons such
as <i>Potamogeton</i> and <i>Arundo</i>. This flora was widely spread and
uniform; there was great similarity between that of Europe and
N. America, and in parts of the United States (Virginia and
Maryland) the plants were very like those in Greenland. The
general aspect of the flora was sub-tropical; the eucalyptus and
other plants then common in Europe and N. America are now
confined to the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The marine fauna comprised foraminifera which must have
swarmed in the Chalk and some of the limestone seas; their
shells have formed great thickness of rock. Common forms are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
the genera <i>Alveolina</i>, <i>Cristellaria</i>, <i>Rotalia</i>, <i>Textularia</i>, <i>Orbitolina</i>,
<i>Globigerina</i>. Radiolarians were doubtless abundant, but
their remains are rare. Sponges with calcareous (<i>Peronidilla</i>,
<i>Barroisia</i>) and siliceous skeletons (<i>Siphonia</i>, <i>Coeloptychium</i>,
<i>Ventriculites</i>) were very numerous in certain of the Cretaceous
waters. Corals were comparatively rare, <i>Trochosmilia</i>, <i>Parasmilia</i>,
<i>Holocystis</i> being typical genera; reefs were formed in the
Maestricht beds of Denmark and Faxoe, in the Neocomian and
Turonian of France, in the Turonian of the Alps and Pyrenees,
and also in the Gosau beds and in the Utatur group of India.
Sea-urchins were a conspicuous feature, and many nearly allied
forms are still living; <i>Cidaris</i>, <i>Micraster</i>, <i>Discoidea</i> are examples.
Crinoids were represented by <i>Marsupites</i>, <i>Uintacrinus</i> and
<i>Bourgueticrinus</i>; starfish (<i>Calliderma</i> and <i>Pentagonaster</i>) were
not uncommon. Polyzoa were abundant; brachiopods were
fairly common, though subordinate to the pelecypods; they were
mostly rhynchonellids and terebratulids, which lived side by
side with the ancient forms, like <i>Crania</i> and <i>Discina</i>. The
bivalve mollusca were very important during this period,
<i>Inoceramus</i>, <i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Spondylus</i>, <i>Gervillia</i>, <i>Exogyra</i>, <i>Pecten</i>,
<i>Trigonia</i> being particularly abundant in the northern seas,
while in the southern waters the remarkable <i>Hippurites</i>, <i>Radiolites</i>,
<i>Caprotina</i>, <i>Caprina</i>, <i>Monopleura</i> and <i>Requienia</i> prevailed.
Gasteropods were well represented and included many modern
genera. Cephalopods were important as a group, but the
ammonites, so vigorous in the foregoing period, were declining
and were assuming curious degenerate forms, often with a
tendency to uncoil the shell; <i>Baculites</i>, <i>Hoplites</i>, <i>Turrilites</i>,
<i>Ptychoceras</i>, <i>Hamites</i> are some of the typical genera, while
<i>Belemnites</i> and <i>Belemnitella</i> were abundant in the northern seas.</p>

<p>The vertebrate fauna of the Cretaceous period differed in many
features from that of the present day; mammals appear to have
been only poorly represented by puny forms, related to Triassic
and Jurassic types; they were mainly marsupials (<i>Batodon</i>,
<i>Cimolestes</i>) with a few monotreme-like forms; carnivores,
rodents and ungulates were still unknown. As in Jurassic times,
reptiles were the dominant forms, and not a few genera lived
on from the former period into the Cretaceous; but, on the whole,
the reptilian assemblage was no longer so varied, and most of the
distinctive mesozoic types had passed away
before the close of this period. Dinosaurs
were represented by herbivorous and carnivorous
genera as in the Jurassic period, but the
latter were less abundant than before. The
<i>Iguanodon</i> of the Sussex-Weald and Bernissart
in Belgium is perhaps the best-known genus;
but there were many others, their remains
being particularly abundant and well-preserved
in the Cretaceous deposits of N. America.
<i>Titanosaurus</i>, <i>Acanthopholis</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i>
and <i>Hypsilophodon</i> may be mentioned, some
of these being of great size, while <i>Diclonius</i>
was a curious duck-billed creature; but most
remarkable in appearance must have been the
horned Dinosaurs, <i>Ceratops</i> and <i>Triceratops</i>,
gross, unwieldy creatures, 25 to 30 ft. long,
whose huge heads were grotesquely armed
with horns and bony frills.</p>

<p>Coincident, perhaps, with the widespread extension of the
sea was the development of aquatic habits and structures suitable
thereto amongst all the reptilian groups including also the birds.
The foremost place was undoubtedly taken by the pythonomorphs
or sea-serpents, including <i>Mosasaurus</i> and many others;
these were enormously elongated creatures, reaching up to 75 ft.,
with swimming flappers and powerful swimming tails, and they
lived a predatory life in the open sea. Ichthyosaurians soon
disappeared from Cretaceous waters; but the plesiosaurians
(<i>Cimoliosaurus</i> and others) reached their maximum development
in this period. The remarkable flying lizards, pterosaurs,
likewise attained their great development and then passed away;
they ranged in size from that of a pigeon to creatures with a
wing-spread of 25 ft.; notable genera are <i>Pteranodon</i>, <i>Ornithocheirus</i>,
<i>Nyctiosaurus</i>. Ordinary lizard-like forms were represented
by <i>Coniosaurus</i>, <i>Dolichosaurus</i>, &amp;c.; and true crocodiles,
<i>Goniopholis</i>, <i>Suchosaurus</i>, appeared in this period, and continued
to approximate to modern genera. The earliest known river
turtles are found in the Belly River deposits of Canada; marine
turtles also made their first appearance and were widely represented,
some of them, <i>Archelon</i> and <i>Protostega</i>, being of great
size. True snakes appeared later in the period.</p>

<p>The birds, as far as existing evidence goes, were aquatic;
some, like <i>Ichthyornis</i>, were built for powerful flight; others, like
<i>Hesperornis</i>, were flightless. <i>Enaliornis</i> is a form well known
from the Cambridge Greensand. They were toothed birds having
structural affinities with the Dinosaurs and Pterodactyles.</p>

<p>Fish remains of this period show that a marked change was
taking place; teleosteans (with bony internal skeleton) were
taking a more prominent place, and although ganoids were still
represented (<i>Macropoma</i>, <i>Lepidotus</i>, <i>Amiopris</i>, &amp;c.) they had
quite ceased to be the dominant types before the close of Cretaceous
times. Sharks and rays were of the modern types, though
distinct in species. Amongst the early forms of Cretaceous
teleosteans may be mentioned <i>Elopopsis</i>, <i>Ichthyodectes</i>, <i>Diplomystus</i>
(herring), <i>Haplopteryx</i> and <i>Urenchelys</i> (eel).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRETE<a name="ar243" id="ar243"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Krêtê">&#922;&#961;&#942;&#964;&#951;</span>; Turk. <i>Kirid</i>, Ital. <i>Candia</i>), after Sicily, Sardinia
and Cyprus the largest island in the Mediterranean, situated
between 34° 50&prime; and 35° 40&prime; N. lat. and between 23° 30&prime; and 26° 20&prime; E.
long. Its north-eastern extremity, Cape Sidero, is distant about
110 m. from Cape Krio in Asia Minor, the interval being partly
filled by the islands of Carpathos and Rhodes; its north-western,
Cape Grabusa, is within 60 m. of Cape Malea in the Morea.
Crete thus forms the natural limit between the Mediterranean
and the Archipelago. The island is of elongated form; its length
from E. to W. is 160 m., its breadth from N. to S. varies from
35 to 7½ m., its area is 3330 sq. m. The northern coast-line is
much indented. On the W. two narrow mountainous promontories,
the western terminating in Cape Grabusa or Busa
(ancient Corycus), the eastern in Cape Spada, shut in the Bay
of Kisamos; beyond the Bay of Canea, to the E., the rocky
peninsula of Akrotiri shelters the magnificent natural harbour
of Suda (8½ sq. m.), the only completely protected anchorage
for large vessels which the island affords. Farther E. are the bays
of Candia and Malea, the deep Mirabello Bay and the Bay of
Sitia. The south coast is less broken, and possesses no natural
harbours, the mountains in many parts rising almost like a wall
from the sea; in the centre is Cape Lithinos, the southernmost
point of the island, partly sheltering the Bay of Messará on the
W. Immediately to the E. of Cape Lithinos is the small bay of
Kali Liménes or Fair Havens, where the ship conveying St Paul
took refuge (Acts xxvii. 8). Of the islands in the neighbourhood
of the Cretan coast the largest is Gavdo (ancient Clauda, Acts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
xxvii. 16), about 25 m. from the south coast at Sphakia, in the
middle ages the see of a bishop. On the N. side the small island
of Dia, or Standia, about 8 m. from Candia, offers a convenient
shelter against northerly gales. Three small islands on the
northern coast&mdash;Grabusa at the N.W. extremity, Suda, at the
entrance to Suda harbour, and Spinalonga, in Mirabello Bay&mdash;remained
for some time in the possession of Venice after the
conquest of Crete by the Turks. Grabusa, long regarded as an
impregnable fortress, was surrendered in 1692, Suda (where the
flags of Turkey and the four protecting powers are now hoisted)
and Spinalonga in 1715.</p>

<p><i>Natural Features.</i>&mdash;The greater part of the island is occupied
by ranges of mountains which form four principal groups. In
the western portion rises the massive range of the White
Mountains (<i>Aspra Vouna</i>), directly overhanging the southern
coast with spurs projecting towards the W. and N.W. (highest
summit, Hagios Theodoros, 7882 ft.). In the centre is the smaller,
almost detached mass of Psiloriti (<span class="grk" title="Hypsiloreition">&#8025;&#968;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>, ancient Ida),
culminating in Stavros (8193 ft.), the highest summit in the
island. To the E. are the Lassithi mountains with Aphenti Christos
(7165 ft.), and farther E. the mountains of Sitia with Aphenti
Kavousi (4850 ft.). The Kophino mountains (3888 ft.) separate
the central plain of Messará from the southern coast. The
isolated peak of Iuktas (about 2700 ft.), nearly due S. of Candia,
was regarded with veneration in antiquity as the burial-place of
Zeus. The principal groups are for the greater part of the year
covered with snow, which remains in the deeper clefts throughout
the summer; the intervals between them are filled by connecting
chains which sometimes reach the height of 3000 ft. The largest
plain is that of Monofatsi and Messará, a fertile tract extending
between Mt. Psiloriti and the Kophino range, about 37 m. in
length and 10 m. in breadth. The smaller plain, or rather slope,
adjoining Canea and the valley of Alikianú, through which the
Platanos (ancient Iardanos) flows, are of great beauty and
fertility. A peculiar feature is presented by the level upland
basins which furnish abundant pasturage during the summer
months; the more remarkable are the Omalo in the White
Mountains (about 4000 ft.) drained by subterranean outlets
(<span class="grk" title="katábothra">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#952;&#961;&#945;</span>), Nida (<span class="grk" title="eis tên Idan">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7996;&#948;&#945;&#957;</span>) in Psiloriti (between 5000 and
6000 ft.), and the Lassithi plain (about 3000 ft.), a more extensive
area, on which are several villages. Another remarkable
characteristic is found in the deep narrow ravines (<span class="grk" title="pharángia">&#966;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>),
bordered by precipitous cliffs, which traverse the mountainous
districts; into some of these the daylight scarcely penetrates.
Numerous large caves exist in the mountains; among the most
remarkable are the famous Idaean cave in Psiloriti, the caves of
Melidoni, in Mylopotamo, and Sarchu, in Malevisi, which sheltered
hundreds of refugees after the insurrection of 1866, and the
Dictaean cave in Lassithi, the birth-place of Zeus. The so-called
Labyrinth, near the ruins of Gortyna, was a subterranean quarry
from which the city was built. The principal rivers are the
Metropoli Potamos and the Anapothiari, which drain the plain of
Monofatsi and enter the southern sea E. and W. respectively
of the Kophino range; the Platanos, which flows northwards
from the White Mountains into the Bay of Canea; and the
Mylopotamo (ancient Oaxes) flowing northwards from Psiloriti
to the sea E. of Retimo.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i><a name="FnAnchor_1m" id="FnAnchor_1m" href="#Footnote_1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a>&mdash;The metamorphic rocks of western Crete form a series
some 9000 to 10,000 ft. in thickness, of very varied composition.
They include gypsum, dolomite, conglomerates, phyllites, and a
basic series of eruptive rocks (gabbros, peridotites, serpentines).
Glaucophane rocks are widely spread. In the centre of the folds
fossiliferous beds with crinoids have been found, and the black slates
at the top of the series contain <i>Myophoria</i> and other fossils, indicating
that the rocks are of Triassic age. It is, however, not impossible
that the metamorphic series includes also some of the Lias. The later
beds of the island belong to the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary
systems. At the western foot of the Ida massif calcareous beds with
corals, brachiopods (<i>Rhynchonella inconstans</i>, &amp;c.) have been found,
the fossils indicating the horizon of the Kimmeridge clay. Lower
Cretaceous limestones and schists, with radiolarian cherts, arc extensively
developed; and in many parts of the island Upper Cretaceous
limestones with <i>Rudistes</i> and Eocene beds with nummulites
have been found. All these are involved in the earth movements
to which the mountains of the island owe their formation, but the
Miocene beds (with <i>Clypeaster</i>) and later deposits lie almost undisturbed
upon the coasts and the low-lying ground. With the
Jurassic beds is associated an extensive series of eruptive rocks
(gabbro, peridotite, serpentine, diorite, granite, &amp;c.); they are
chiefly of Jurassic age, but the eruptions may have continued into
the Lower Cretaceous.</p>

<p>The structure of the island is complex. In the west the folds run
from north to south, curving gradually westward towards the
southern and western coasts; but in the east the folds appear to
run from west to east, and to be the continuation of the Dinaric
folds of the Balkan peninsula. The structure is further complicated
by a great thrust-plane which has brought the Jurassic and Lower
Cretaceous beds upon the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene beds.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Vegetation.</i>&mdash;The forests which once covered the mountains
have for the most part disappeared and the slopes are now
desolate wastes. The cypress still grows wild in the higher
regions; the lower hills and the valleys, which are extremely
fertile, are covered with olive woods. Oranges and lemons also
abound, and are of excellent quality, furnishing almost the whole
supply of continental Greece and Constantinople. Chestnut
woods are found in the Selino district, and forests of the valonia
oak in that of Retimo; in some parts the carob tree is abundant
and supplies an important article of consumption. Pears, apples,
quinces, mulberries and other fruit-trees flourish, as well as vines;
the Cretan wines, however, no longer enjoy the reputation which
they possessed in the time of the Venetians. Tobacco and cotton
succeed well in the plains and low grounds, though not at present
cultivated to any great extent.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i>&mdash;Of the wild animals of Crete, the wild goat or
<i>agrimi (Capra aegagrus)</i> alone need be mentioned; it is still found
in considerable numbers on the higher summits of Psiloriti and
the White Mountains. The same species is found in the Caucasus
and Mount Taurus, and is distinct from the ibex or bouquetin of
the Alps. Crete, like several other large islands, enjoys immunity
from dangerous serpents&mdash;a privilege ascribed by popular belief
to the intercession of Titus, the companion of St Paul, who according
to tradition was the first bishop of the island, and became in
consequence its patron saint. Wolves also are not found in the
island, though common in Greece and Asia Minor. The native
breed of mules is remarkably fine.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of Crete under the Venetians was
estimated at about 250,000. After the Turkish conquest it
greatly diminished, but afterwards gradually rose, till it was
supposed to have attained to about 260,000, of whom about half
were Mahommedans, at the time of the outbreak of the Greek
revolution in 1821. The ravages of the war from 1821 to 1830,
and the emigration that followed, caused a great diminution, and
the population was estimated by Pashley in 1836 at only about
130,000. In the next generation it again materially increased;
it was calculated by Spratt in 1865 as amounting to 210,000.
According to the census taken in 1881, the complete publication
of which was interdicted by the Turkish authorities, the population
of the island was 279,165, or 35.78 to the square kilometre.
Of this total, 141,602 were males, 137,563 females; 33,173 were
literate, 242,114 illiterate; 205,010 were orthodox Christians,
73,234 Moslems, and 921 of other religious persuasions. The
Moslem element predominated in the principal towns, of which
the population was&mdash;Candia, 21,368; Canea, 13,812; Retimo,
9274. According to the census taken in June 1900, the population
of the island was 301,273, the Christians having increased
to 267,266, while the Moslems had diminished to 33,281. The
Moslems, as well as the Christians, are of Greek origin and speak
Greek.</p>

<p><i>Towns.</i>&mdash;The three principal towns are on the northern coast
and possess small harbours suitable for vessels of light draught.
Candia, the former capital and the see of the archbishop of Crete
(pop. in 1900, 22,501), is officially styled Herákleion; it is
surrounded by remarkable Venetian fortifications and possesses
a museum with a valuable collection of objects found at Cnossus,
Phaestus, the Idaean cave and elsewhere. It has been occupied
since 1897 by British troops. Canea (Xaviá), the seat of government
since 1840 (pop. 20,972), is built in the Italian style; its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
walls and interesting galley-slips recall the Venetian period.
The residence of the high commissioner and the consulates of
the powers are in the suburb of Halepa. Retimo  <span class="grk" title="Rethumnos">&#929;&#941;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> is,
like Canea, the see of a bishop (pop. 9311). The other towns,
Hierapetra, Sitia, Kisamos, Selino and Sphakia, are unimportant.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Production and Industries.</i>&mdash;Owing to the volcanic nature of
its soil, Crete is probably rich in minerals. Recent experiments
lead to the conclusion that iron, lead, manganese, lignite and
sulphur exist in considerable abundance. Copper and zinc have
also been found. A large number of applications for mining concessions
have been received since the establishment of the autonomous
government. The principal wealth of the island is derived from
its olive groves; notwithstanding the destruction of many thousands
of trees during each successive insurrection, the production
is apparently undiminished, and will probably increase very considerably
owing to the planting of young trees and the improved
methods of cultivation which the Government is endeavouring to
promote. The orange and lemon groves have also suffered considerably,
but new varieties of the orange tree are now being introduced,
and an impulse will be given to the export trade in this fruit
by the removal of the restriction on its importation into Greece.
Agriculture is still in a primitive condition; notwithstanding the
fertility of the arable land the supply of cereals is far below the
requirements of the population. A great portion of the central plain
of Monofatsi, the principal grain-producing district, is lying fallow
owing to the exodus of the Moslem peasantry. The cultivation of
silk cocoons, formerly a flourishing industry, has greatly declined in
recent years, but efforts are now being made to revive it. There
are few manufactures. Soap is produced at fifteen factories in the
principal towns, and there are two distilleries of cognac at Candia.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The expansion of Cretan commerce has been retarded
by many drawbacks, such as the unsatisfactory condition of the
harbours, the want of direct steamship lines to England and other
countries, and the deficiency of internal communications. The total
value of imports in the four years 1901-1904 was £1,756,888, of
exports £1,386,777; excess of imports over exports, £370,111.
Exports in 1904 were valued at £419,642, the principal items being
agricultural products (oranges, lemons, carobs, almonds, grapes,
valonia, &amp;c.), value £153,858, olives and products of olives (oil, soap,
&amp;c.), £134,788, and wines and liquors, £48,544. The countries which
accept the largest share of Cretan produce are Turkey, England,
Egypt, Austria and Russia. Imports in 1904 were valued at
£549,665, including agricultural products (mainly flour and corn),
value £162,535, and textiles, £129,349. Cereals are imported from
the Black Sea and Danube ports, ready-made clothing from Austria
and Germany, articles of luxury from Austria and France, and
cotton textiles from England. Imports are charged 8%, exports
1% <i>ad valorem</i> duty. According to a law published in 1899, Turkish
merchandise became subjected to the same rates as that of foreign
nations.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Constitution and Government.</i>&mdash;During the past half-century
the affairs of Crete have repeatedly occupied the attention of
Europe. Owing to the existence of a strong Mussulman minority
among its inhabitants, the warlike character of the natives, and
the mountainous configuration of the country, which enabled a
portion of the Christian population to maintain itself in a state
of partial independence, the island has constantly been the scene
of prolonged and sanguinary struggles in which the numerical
superiority of the Christians was counterbalanced by the aid
rendered to the Moslems by the Ottoman troops. This unhappy
state of affairs was aggravated and perpetuated by the intrigues
set on foot at Constantinople against successive governors of the
island, the conflicts between the Palace and the Porte, the
duplicity of the Turkish authorities, the dissensions of the
representatives of the great powers, the machinations of Greek
agitators, the rivalry of Cretan politicians, and prolonged financial
mismanagement. A long series of insurrections&mdash;those of 1821,
1833, 1841, 1858, 1866-1868, 1878, 1889 and 1896 may be
especially mentioned&mdash;culminated in the general rebellion of
1897, which led to the interference of Greece, the intervention of
the great powers, the expulsion of the Turkish authorities, and
the establishment of an autonomous Cretan government under
the suzerainty of the sultan. According to the autonomous
constitution of 1899 the supreme power was vested in Prince
George of Greece, acting as high commissioner of the protecting
powers. The authority thus conferred was confided exclusively
to the prince, and was declared liable to modification by law in the
case of his successor. The modified constitution of February 1907
curtailed the large exceptional legislative and administrative
powers then accorded. The high commissioner is irresponsible,
but his decrees, except in certain specified cases, must be countersigned
by a member of his council. He convokes, prorogues and
dissolves the chamber, sanctions laws, exercises the right of
pardon in case of political offences, represents the island in its
foreign relations and is chief of its military forces. The chamber
(<span class="grk" title="boulê">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#942;</span>), which is elected in the proportion of one deputy to every
5000 inhabitants, meets annually for a session of two months.
New elections are held every two years. The chamber exercises
a complete financial control, and no taxes can be imposed without
its consent. The high commissioner is aided in the administration
by a cabinet of three members, styled &ldquo;councillors&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="symbouloi">&#963;&#973;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>), who superintend the departments of justice,
finance, education, public security and the interior. The
councillors, who are nominated and dismissed by the high commissioner,
are responsible to the chamber, which may impeach
them before a special tribunal for any illegal act or neglect of duty.</p>

<p>In general the Cretan constitution is characterized by a conservative
spirit, and contrasts with the ultra-democratic systems
established in Greece and the Balkan States. A further point of
difference is the more liberal payment of public functionaries in
Crete. For administrative purposes the departmental divisions
existing under the Turkish government have been retained.
There are 5 <i>nomoi</i> or prefectures (formerly <i>sanjaks</i>) each under a
prefect (<span class="grk" title="nomárchos">&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span>), and 23 eparchies (formerly <i>kazas</i>) each under
a sub-prefect (<span class="grk" title="éparchos">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span>). All these functionaries are nominated
by the high commissioner. The prefects are assisted by departmental
councils. The system of municipal and communal
government remains practically unchanged. The island is
divided into 86 communes, each with a mayor, an assistant-mayor,
and a communal council elected by the people. The
councils assess within certain limits the communal taxes,
maintain roads, bridges, &amp;c., and generally superintend local
affairs. Public order is maintained by a force of gendarmerie
(<span class="grk" title=" chôrophulakê">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#942;</span>) organized and at first commanded by Italian
officers, who were replaced by Greek officers in December
1906. The constitution authorizes the formation of a militia
(<span class="grk" title="politophulakê">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#942;</span>) to be enrolled by conscription, but in existing
circumstances the embodiment of this force seems unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>Justice.</i>&mdash;The administration of justice is on the French model.
A supreme court of appeal, which also discharges the functions of
a court of cassation, sits at Canea. There are two assize courts at
Canea and Candia respectively with jurisdiction in regard to
serious offences (<span class="grk" title="kakourgêmata ">&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>). Minor offences (<span class="grk" title="plêmmelêmata">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#956;&#949;&#955;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>)
and civil causes are tried by courts of first instance in each of the
five departments. There are 26 justices of peace, to whose
decision are referred slight contraventions of the law (<span class="grk" title="ptaismata">&#960;&#964;&#945;&#943;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>)
and civil causes in which the amount claimed is below 600 francs.
These functionaries also hold monthly sessions in the various
communes. The judges are chosen without regard to religious
belief, and precautions have been taken to render them
independent of political parties. They are appointed, promoted,
transferred or removed by order of the council of justice, a body
composed of the five highest judicial dignitaries, sitting at Canea.
An order for the removal of a judge must be based upon a conviction
for some specified offence before a court of law. The
jury system has not been introduced. The Greek penal code
has been adopted with some modifications. The Ottoman civil
code is maintained for the present, but it is proposed to establish
a code recently drawn up by Greek jurists which is mainly based
on Italian and Saxon law. The Mussulman cadis retain their
jurisdiction in regard to religious affairs, marriage, divorce,
the wardship of minors and inheritance.</p>

<p><i>Religion and Education.</i>&mdash;The vast majority of the Christian
population belongs to the Orthodox (Greek) Church, which is
governed by a synod of seven bishops under the presidency of
the metropolitan of Candia. The Cretan Church is not, strictly
speaking, autocephalous, being dependent on the patriarchate
of Constantinople. There were in 1907 3500 Greek churches
in the island with 53 monasteries and 3 nunneries; 55 mosques,
4 Roman Catholic churches and 4 synagogues. Education is
nominally compulsory. In 1907 there were 547 primary schools
(527 Christian and 20 Mahommedan), and 31 secondary schools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
(all Christian). About £20,000 is granted annually by the state
for the purposes of education.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;Owing to the havoc wrought during repeated insurrections,
the impoverishment of the peasants, the desolation of the
districts formerly inhabited by the Moslem agricultural population,
and the drain of gold resulting from the sale of Moslem lands and
emigration of the former proprietors, together with other causes,
the financial situation has been unsatisfactory. Notwithstanding
the advance of £160,000 made by the four protecting powers after
the institution of autonomous government and the profits (£61,937)
derived from the issue of a new currency in 1900, there was at the
beginning of 1906 an accumulated deficit of £23,470, which represents
the floating debt. In addition to the above-mentioned debt to the
powers, the state contracted a loan of £60,000 in 1901 to acquire
the rights and privileges of the Ottoman Debt, to which the salt
monopoly has been conceded for 20 years. In the budgets for 1905
and 1906 considerable economies were effected by the curtailment
of salaries, the abolition of various posts, and the reduction of the
estimates for education and public works. The estimated revenue
and expenditure for 1906 were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The salary of the high commissioner was reduced in 1907 to 100,000
drachmae.</p>

<p>Improved communications are much needed for the transport of
agricultural produce, but the state of the treasury does not admit of
more than a nominal expenditure on road-making and other public
works. On these the average yearly expenditure between 1898 and
1905 was £13,404. The prosperity of the island depends on the
development of agriculture, the acquirement of industrious habits
by the people, and the abandonment of political agitation. The
Cretans were in 1906 more lightly taxed than any other people in
Europe. The tithe had been replaced by an export tax on exported
agricultural produce levied at the custom-houses, and the smaller
peasant proprietors and shepherds of the mountainous districts
were practically exempt from any contribution to the state. The
communal tax did not exceed on the average two francs annually
for each family. The poorer communes are aided by a state
subvention.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Archaeology.</i></p>

<p>The recent exploration and excavation of early sites
in Crete have entirely revolutionized our knowledge of its
remote past, and afforded the most astonishing
evidence of the existence of a highly advanced
<span class="sidenote">Early, Middle and Late &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; periods.</span>
civilization going far back behind the historic period.
Great &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; palaces have been brought to
light at Cnossus and Phaestus, together with a minor
but highly interesting royal abode at Hagia Triada near
Phaestus. &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; towns, some of considerable extent,
have been discovered at Cnossus itself, at Gournia, Palaikastro,
and at Zakro. The cave sanctuary of the Dictaean Zeus
has been explored, and throughout the whole length and
breadth of the island a mass of early materials has now
been collected. The comparative evidence afforded by the discovery
of Egyptian relics shows that the Great Age of the Cretan
palaces covers the close of the third and the first half of the
second millennium before our era. But the contents of early tombs
and dwellings and indications supplied by such objects as stone
vases and seal-stones show that the Cretans had already attained
to a considerable degree of culture, and had opened out communication
with the Nile valley in the time of the earliest
Egyptian dynasties. This more primitive phase of the indigenous
culture, of which several distinct stages are traceable, is known
as the Early Minoan, and roughly corresponds with the first
half of the third millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The succeeding period, to
which the first palaces are due and to which the name of
Middle Minoan is appropriately given, roughly coincides with the
Middle Empire of Egypt. An extraordinary perfection was at
this time attained in many branches of art, notably in the painted
pottery, often with polychrome decoration, of a class known as
&ldquo;Kamares&rdquo; from its first discovery in a cave of that name on
Mount Ida. Imported specimens of this ware were found by
Flinders Petrie among XIIth Dynasty remains at Kahun.
The beginnings of a school of wall painting also go back to the
Middle Minoan period, and metal technique and such arts as
gem engraving show great advance. By the close of this period
a manufactory of fine faience was attached to the palace of
Cnossus. The succeeding Late Minoan period, best illustrated
by the later palace at Cnossus and that at Hagia Triada, corresponds
in Egypt with the Hyksos period and the earlier part of
the New Empire. In the first phase of this the Minoan civilization
attains its acme, and the succeeding style already shows
much that may be described as rococo. The later phase, which
follows on the destruction of the Cnossian palace, and corresponds
with the diffused Mycenaean style of mainland Greece and elsewhere,
is already partly decadent. Late Minoan art in its finest
aspect is best illustrated by the animated ivory figures, wall
paintings, and <i>gesso duro</i> reliefs at Cnossus, by the painted stucco
designs at Hagia Triada, and the steatite vases found on the same
site with zones in reliefs exhibiting life-like scenes of warriors,
toreadors, gladiators, wrestlers and pugilists, and of a festal
throng perhaps representing a kind of &ldquo;harvest home.&rdquo; Of
the more conventional side of Late Minoan life a graphic illustration
is supplied by the remains of miniature wall paintings found
in the palace of Cnossus, showing groups of court ladies in
curiously modern costumes, seated on the terraces and balustrades
of a sanctuary. A grand &ldquo;palace style&rdquo; of vase painting was
at the same time evolved, in harmony with the general decoration
of the royal halls.</p>

<p>It had been held till lately that the great civilization of prehistoric
Greece, as first revealed to us by Schliemann&rsquo;s discoveries
at Mycenae, was not possessed of the art of writing.
In 1893, however, Arthur Evans observed some signs on
<span class="sidenote">Minoan script.</span>
seal-stones from Crete which led him to believe that a
hieroglyphic system of writing had existed in Minoan times.
Explorations carried out by him in Crete from 1894 onwards, for
the purpose of investigating the prehistoric civilization of the
island, fully corroborated this belief, and showed that a linear
as well as a semi-pictorial form of writing was diffused in the
island at a very early period (&ldquo;Cretan Pictographs and Prae-Phoenician
Script,&rdquo; <i>Journ. of Hellenic Studies</i>, xiv. pt. 11).
In 1895 he obtained a libation-table from the Dictaean cave with
a linear dedication in the prehistoric writing (&ldquo;Further Discoveries,&rdquo;
&amp;c., <i>J.H.S.</i> xvii.). Finally in 1900 all scepticism in
the learned world was set at rest by his discovery in the palace of
Cnossus of whole archives consisting of clay tablets inscribed both
in the pictographic (hieroglyphic) and linear forms of the Minoan
script (Evans, &ldquo;Palace of Knossos,&rdquo; <i>Reports of Excavation,
1900-1905</i>; <i>Scripta Minoa</i>, vol. i., 1909). Supplementary
finds of inscribed tablets have since been found at Hagia Triada
(F. Halbherr, <i>Rapporto, &amp;c., Monumenti antichi</i>, 1903) and
elsewhere (Palaikastro, Zakro and Gournia). It thus appears
that a highly developed system of writing existed in Minoan
Crete some two thousand years earlier than the first introduction
under Phoenician influence of Greek letters. In this, as in so
many other respects, the old Cretan tradition receives striking
confirmation. According to the Cretan version preserved by
Diodorus (v. 74), the Phoenicians did not invent letters but
simply altered their forms.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the use in Crete of both linear and
pictorial signs existed in the Early Minoan period, contemporary
with the first Egyptian dynasties. It is, however,
during the Middle Minoan age, the centre point of which
<span class="sidenote">Earlier pictographic script.</span>
corresponds with the XIIth Egyptian dynasty, according
to the Sothic system of dating, c. 2000-1850 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
that a systematized pictographic or hieroglyphic script makes
its appearance which is common both to signets and clay tablets.
During the Third Middle Minoan period, the lower limits of
which approach 1600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, this pictographic script finally gives
way to a still more developed linear system&mdash;which is itself
divided into an earlier and a later class. The earlier class (A)
is already found in the temple repositories of Cnossus belonging
to the age immediately preceding the great remodelling of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
palace, and this class is specially well represented in the
tablets of Hagia Triada (M.M. iii. and L.M. i.). The later class
(B) of the linear script is that used on the great bulk of the
clay tablets of the Cnossian palace, amounting in number to
nearly 2000.</p>

<p>These clay archives are almost exclusively inventories and
business documents. Their general purport is shown in many
cases by pictorial figures relating to various objects which appear
on them&mdash;such as chariots and horses, ingots and metal vases,
arms and implements, stores of corn, &amp;c., flocks and herds. Many
showing human figures apparently contain lists of personal names.
A decimal system of numeration was used, with numbers going
up to 10,000. But the script itself is as yet undeciphered, though
it is clear that certain words have changing suffixes, and that
there were many compound words. The script also recurs on
walls in the shape of graffiti, and on vases, sometimes ink-written;
and from the number of seals originally attached to perishable
documents it is probable that parchment or some similar material
was also used. In the easternmost district of Crete, where the
aboriginal &ldquo;Eteocretan&rdquo; element survived to historic times
(Praesus, Palaikastro), later inscriptions have been discovered
belonging to the 5th and succeeding centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, written in
Greek letters but in the indigenous language (Comparetti, <i>Mon.
Ant.</i> iii. 451 sqq.; R. S. Conway, <i>British School Annual</i>, viii.
125 sqq. and ib. xl.). In 1908 a remarkable discovery was made
by the Italian Mission at Phaestus of a clay disk with imprinted
hieroglyphic characters belonging to a non-Cretan system and
probably from W. Anatolia.</p>

<p>The remains of several shrines within the building, and the
religious element perceptible in the frescoes, show that a considerable
part of the Palace of Cnossus was devoted
to purposes of cult. It is clear that the rulers, as so
<span class="sidenote">Character of Minoan religion.</span>
commonly in ancient states, fulfilled priestly as well as
royal functions. The evidence supplied by this and
other Cretan sites shows that the principal Minoan divinity was a
kind of <i>Magna Mater</i>, a Great Mother or nature goddess, with
whom was associated a male satellite. The cult in fact corresponds
in its main outlines with the early religious conceptions of
Syria and a large part of Anatolia&mdash;a correspondence probably
explained by a considerable amount of ethnic affinity existing
between a large section of the primitive Cretan population and
that of southern Asia Minor. The Minoan goddess is sometimes
seen in her chthonic form with serpents, sometimes in a more
celestial aspect with doves, at times with lions. One part of her
religious being survives in that of the later Rhea, another in that
of Aphrodite, one of whose epithets, <i>Ariadne</i> ( = the exceeding
holy), takes us back to the earliest Cnossian tradition. Under her
native name, Britomartis ( = the sweet maiden) or Dictynna, she
approaches Artemis and Leto, again associated with an infant
god, and this Cretan virgin goddess was worshipped in Aegina
under the name of Aphaea. It is noteworthy that whereas, in
Greece proper, Zeus attains a supreme position, the old superiority
of the Mother Goddess is still visible in the Cretan traditions
of Rhea and Dictynna and the infant Zeus.</p>

<p>Although images of the divinities were certainly known, the
principal objects of cult in the Minoan age were of the aniconic
class; in many cases these were natural objects, such as rocks and
mountain peaks, with their cave sanctuaries, like those of Ida
or of Dicte. Trees and curiously shaped stones were also
worshipped, and artificial pillars of wood or stone. These latter,
as in the well-known case of the Lion&rsquo;s Gate at Mycenae, often
appear with guardian animals as their supporters. The essential
feature of this cult is the bringing down of the celestial spirit by
proper incantations and ritual into these fetish objects, the dove
perched on a column sometimes indicating its descent. It is a
primitive cult similar to that of Early Canaan, illustrated by the
pillow stone set up by Jacob, which was literally &ldquo;Bethel&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;House of God.&rdquo; The story of the <i>baetylus</i>, or stone swallowed
by Saturn under the belief that it was his son, the Cretan Zeus,
seems to cover the same idea and has been derived from the same
Semitic word.</p>

<p>A special form of this &ldquo;baetylic&rdquo; cult in Minoan Crete was the
representation of the two principal divinities in their fetish form
by double axes. Shrines of the Double Axes have been found in
the palace of Cnossus itself, at Hagia Triada, and in a small
palace at Gournia, and many specimens of the sacred emblem
occurred in the Cave Sanctuary of Dicte, the mythical birthplace
of the Cretan Zeus. Complete scenes of worship in which libations
are poured before the Sacred Axes are, moreover, given on a fine
painted sarcophagus found at Hagia Triada.</p>

<p>The same cult survived to later times in Caria in the case of
Zeus Labrandeus, whose name is derived from <i>labrys</i>, the native
name for the double axe, and it had already been
suggested on philological grounds that the Cretan
<span class="sidenote">Labyrinth and Minotaur.</span>
&ldquo;labyrinthos&rdquo; was formed from a kindred form of
the same word. The discovery that the great Minoan
foundation at Cnossus was at once a palace and a sanctuary of
the Double Axe and its associated divinities has now supplied a
striking and it may well be thought an overwhelming confirmation
of this view. We can hardly any longer hesitate to recognize
in this vast building, with its winding corridors and subterranean
ducts, the Labyrinth of later tradition; and as a matter of fact a
maze pattern recalling the conventional representation of the
Labyrinth in Greek art actually formed the decoration of one of
the corridors of the palace. It is difficult, moreover, not to
connect the repeated wall-paintings and reliefs of the palace
illustrating the cruel bull sports of the Minoan arena, in which
girls as well as youths took part, with the legend of the Minotaur,
or bull of Minos, for whose grisly meals Athens was forced to pay
annual tribute of her sons and daughters. It appears certain
from the associations in which they are found at Cnossus, that
these Minoan bull sports formed part of a religious ceremony.
Actual figures of a monster with a bull&rsquo;s head and man&rsquo;s body
occurred on seals of Minoan fabric found on this and other
Cretan sites.</p>

<p>It is abundantly evident that whatever mythic element may
have been interwoven with the old traditions of the spot, they
have a solid substratum of reality. With such remains
before us it is no longer sufficient to relegate Minos to
<span class="sidenote">Historic substratum of Cretan myths.</span>
the regions of sun-myths. His legendary presentation
as the &ldquo;Friend of God,&rdquo; like Abraham, to whom as to
Moses the law was revealed on the holy mountain, calls
up indeed just such a priest-king of antiquity as the palace-sanctuary
of Cnossus itself presupposes. It seems possible even that
the ancient tradition which recorded an earlier or later king of the
name of Minos may, as suggested above, cover a dynastic title.
The earlier and later palaces at Cnossus and Phaestus, and the
interrupted phases of each, seem to point to a succession of
dynasties, to which, as to its civilization as a whole, it is certainly
convenient to apply the name &ldquo;Minoan.&rdquo; It is interesting, as
bringing out the personal element in the traditional royal seat,
that an inscribed sealing belonging to the earliest period of the
later palace of Cnossus bears on it the impression of two official
signets with portrait heads of a man and of a boy, recalling the
&ldquo;associations&rdquo; on the coinage of imperial Rome. It is clear that
the later traditions in many respects accurately summed up the
performances of the &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; dynast who carried out the great
buildings now brought to light. The palace, with its wonderful
works of art, executed for Minos by the craftsman Daedalus,
has ceased to belong to the realms of fancy. The extraordinary
architectural skill, the sanitary and hydraulic science revealed in
details of the building, bring us at the same time face to face
with the power of mechanical invention with which Daedalus
was credited. The elaborate method and bureaucratic control
visible in the clay documents of the palace point to a highly
developed legal organization. The powerful fleet and maritime
empire which Minos was said to have established will no doubt
receive fuller illustration when the sea-town of Cnossus comes to
be explored. The appearance of ships on some of the most
important seal-impressions is not needed, however, to show how
widely Minoan influence made itself felt in the neighbouring
Mediterranean regions.</p>

<p>The Nilotic influence visible in the vases, seals and other
fabrics of the Early Minoan age, seems to imply a maritime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
activity on the part of the islanders going back to the days of the
<span class="sidenote">Early relations with Egypt.</span>
first Egyptian dynasties. In a deposit at Kahun, belonging to
the XIIth Dynasty, c. 2000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, were already found
imported polychrome vases of &ldquo;Middle Minoan&rdquo;
fabric. In the same way the important part played by
Cretan enterprise in the days of the New Egyptian
empire is illustrated by repeated finds of Late Minoan pottery
on Egyptian sites. A series of monuments, moreover, belonging
to the early part of the XVIIIth Dynasty show the representatives
<span class="sidenote">The Kefts and Philistines.</span>
of the Kefts or peoples of &ldquo;The Ring&rdquo; and of the
&ldquo;Lands to the West&rdquo; in the fashionable costume of
the Cnossian court, bearing precious vessels and other
objects of typical Minoan forms. Farther to the east
the recent excavations on the old Philistine sites like Gezer have
brought to light swords and vases of Cretan manufacture in the
later palace style. The principal Philistine tribe is indeed known
in the biblical records as the Cherethims or Cretans, and the
Minoan name and the cult of the Cretan Zeus were preserved at
<span class="sidenote">Early relations with Cyprus and N. Aegean.</span>
Gaza to the latest classical days. Similar evidence
of Minoan contact, and indeed of wholesale colonization
from the Aegean side, recurs in Cyprus. The culture of
the more northerly Aegean islands, best revealed to us
by the excavations of the British School at Phylakopi
in Melos, also attest a growing influence from the
Cretan side, which, about the time of the later palace at
Cnossus, becomes finally predominant.</p>

<p>Turning to the mainland of Greece we see that the astonishing
remains of a highly developed prehistoric civilization, which
Schliemann first brought to light in 1876 at Mycenae,
and which from those discoveries received the general
<span class="sidenote">Minoan influence on mainland of Greece.</span>
name of &ldquo;Mycenaean,&rdquo; in the main represent a transmarine
offshoot from the Minoan stock. The earlier
remains both at Mycenae and Tiryns, still imperfectly
investigated, show that this Cretan influence goes back to the
Middle Minoan age, with its characteristic style of polychrome
vase decoration. The contents of the royal tombs, on the other
hand, reveal a wholesale correspondence with the fabrics of the
first, and, to a less degree, the second Late Minoan age, as
illustrated by the relics belonging to the Middle Period of the later
palace at Cnossus and by those of the royal villa at Hagia Triada.
The chronological centre of the great beehive tombs seems to
be slightly lower. The ceiling of that of Orchomenos, and the
painted vases and gold cups from the Vaphio tomb by Sparta,
with their marvellous reliefs showing scenes of bull-hunting,
represent the late palace style at Cnossus in its final development.</p>

<p>The leading characteristics of this mainland civilization are
thus indistinguishable from the Minoan. The funeral rites are
similar, and the religious representations show an identical form
of worship. At the same time the local traditions and conditions
differentiate the continental from the insular branch. In Crete,
in the later period, when the rulers could trust to the &ldquo;wooden
walls&rdquo; of the Minoan navy, there is no parallel for the massive
fortifications that we see at Tiryns or Mycenae. The colder winter
climate of mainland Greece dictated the use of fixed hearths,
whereas in the Cretan palaces these seem to have been of a portable
kind, and the different usage in this respect again reacted
on the respective forms of the principal hall or &ldquo;Megaron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minoan culture under its mainland aspect left its traces on the
Acropolis at Athens,&mdash;a corroboration of the tradition which
made the Athenians send their tribute children to
Minos. Similar traces extend through a large part of
<span class="sidenote">Minoan influences in N. Greece.</span>
northern Greece from Cephallenia and Leucadia to
Thessaly, and are specially well marked at Iolcus (near
mod. Volo), the legendary embarking place of the Argonauts.
This circumstance deserves attention owing to the special connexion
traditionally existing between the Minyans of Iolcus and
those of Orchomenus, the point of all others on this side where
the early Cretan influence seems most to have taken root. The
Minoan remains at Orchomenus which are traceable to the latest
period go far to substantiate the philological comparison between
the name of Minyas, the traditional ancestor of this ancient race,
and that of Minos.</p>

<p>Still farther to the north-west a distinct Minoan influence is
perceptible in the old Illyrian lands east of the Adriatic, and its
traces reappear in the neighbourhood of Venice. It is
well marked throughout southern Italy from Taranto
<span class="sidenote">Adriatic and Italian extension.</span>
to Naples. It was with Sicily, however, that the later
history of Minos and his great craftsman Daedalus was
in a special way connected by ancient tradition. Here, as in
Crete, Daedalus executed great works like the temple of Eryx,
and it was on Sicilian soil that Minos, engaged in a western
campaign, was said to have met with a violent death at the
hands of the native king Kokalos (Cocalus) and his daughters.
His name is preserved in the Sicilian Minoa, and his tomb was
pointed out in the neighbourhood of Agrigentum, with a shrine
above dedicated to his native Aphrodite, the lady of the dove;
and in this connexion it must be observed that the cult of Eryx
perpetuates to much later times the characteristic features of
the worship of the Cretan Nature goddess, as now revealed
to us in the palace of Cnossus and elsewhere. These ancient
indications of a Minoan connexion with Sicily have now received
interesting confirmation in the numerous discoveries, principally
due to the recent excavations of P. Orsi, of arms and painted vases
of Late Minoan fabric in Bronze Age tombs of the provinces of
Syracuse and Girgenti (Agrigentum) belonging to the late Bronze
Age. Some of these objects, such as certain forms of swords and
vases, seem to be of local fabric, but derived from originals going
back to the beginning of the Late Minoan age.</p>

<p>The abiding tradition of the Cretan aborigines, as preserved
by Herodotus (vii. 171), ascribes the eventual settlement of the
Greeks in Crete to a widespread desolation that had
fallen on the central regions. It is certain that by
<span class="sidenote">Minoan crisis: c. 1400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></span>
the beginning of the 14th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when the signs
of already decadent Minoan art are perceptible in the
imported pottery found in the palace of Akhenaton at Tell el-Amarna,
some heavy blows had fallen on the island power.
Shortly before this date the palaces both of Cnossus and Phaestus
had undergone a great destruction, and though during the ensuing
period both these royal residences were partially reoccupied
it was for the most part at any rate by poorer denizens, and their
great days as palaces were over for ever. Elsewhere at Cnossus,
in the smaller palace to the west, the royal villa and the town
houses, we find the evidence of a similar catastrophe followed
by an imperfect recovery, and the phenomenon meets us again
at Palaikastro and other early settlements in the east of Crete.
At the same time, to whatever cause this serious setback of
Minoan civilization was owing, it would be very unsafe to infer
as yet any large displacement of the original inhabitants by the
invading swarms from the mainland or elsewhere. The evidence
of a partial restoration of the domestic quarter of the palace of
Cnossus tends to show a certain measure of dynastic continuity.
There is evidence, moreover, that the script and with it the
indigenous language did not die out during this period, and that
therefore the days of Hellenic settlement at Cnossus were not
yet. The recent exploration of a cemetery belonging to the
close of the great palace period, and in a greater degree to the
age succeeding the catastrophe, has now conclusively shown
that there was no real break in the continuity of Minoan culture.
This third Late Minoan period&mdash;the beginning of which may be
fixed about 1400&mdash;is an age of stagnation and decline, but the
point of departure continued to be the models supplied by the
age that had preceded it. Art was still by no means extinct, and
its forms and decorative elements are simply later derivatives
of the great palace style. Not only the native form of writing,
but the household arrangements, sepulchral usages, and religious
rites remain substantially the same. The third Late Minoan age
corresponds generally with the Late Mycenaean stage in the
Aegean world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aegean Civilization</a></span>). It is an age indeed
in which the culture as a whole, though following a lower level,
attains the greatest amount of uniformity. From Sicily and even
the Spanish coast to the Troad, southern Asia Minor, Cyprus and
Palestine,&mdash;from the Nile valley to the mouth of the Po, very
similar forms were now diffused. Here and there, as in Cyprus,
we watch the development of some local schools. How far Crete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
itself continued to preserve the hegemony which may reasonably
be ascribed to it at an earlier age must remain doubtful. It is
certain that towards the close of this third and concluding
Late Minoan period in the island certain mainland types of swords
and safety-pins make their appearance, which are symptomatic
of the great invasion from that side that was now impending or
had already begun.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Principal Minoan Sites.</i></p>

<p>It will be convenient here to give a general view of the more
important Minoan remains recently excavated on various Cretan
sites.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Cnossus.</i>&mdash;The palace of Cnossus is on the hill of Kephala about
4 m. inland from Candia. As a scene of human settlement this site
is of immense antiquity. The successive &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; strata, which
go well back into the fourth millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, reach down to a depth
of about 17 ft. But below this again is a human deposit, from
20 to 26 ft. in thickness, representing a long and gradual course of
Neolithic or Later Stone-Age development. Assuming that the lower
strata were formed at approximately the same rate as the upper,
we have an antiquity of from 12,000 to 14,000 years indicated for the
first Neolithic settlement on this spot. The hill itself, like a Tell of
Babylonia, is mainly formed of the debris of human settlements.
The palace was approached from the west by a paved Minoan Way
communicating with a considerable building on the opposite hill.
This road was flanked by magazines, some belonging to the royal
armoury, and abutted on a paved area with stepped seats on two
sides (theatral area). The palace itself approximately formed a
square with a large paved court in the centre. It had a N.S. orientation.
The principal entrance was to the north, but what appears to
have been the royal entrance opened on a paved court on the west
side. This entrance communicated with a corridor showing frescoes
of a processional character. The west side of the palace contained
a series of 18 magazines with great store jars and cists and large
hoards of clay documents. A remarkable feature of this quarter is
a small council chamber with a gypsum throne of curiously Gothic
aspect and lower stone benches round. The walls of the throne room
show frescoes with sacred griffins confronting each other in a Nile
landscape, and a small bath chamber&mdash;perhaps of ritual use&mdash;is
attached. This quarter of the palace shows the double axe sign
constantly repeated on its walls and pillars, and remains of miniature
wall-paintings showing pillar shrines, in some cases with double axes
stuck into the wooden columns. Here too were found the repositories
of an early shrine containing exquisite faience figures and reliefs,
including a snake goddess&mdash;another aspect of the native divinity&mdash;and
her votaries. The central object of cult in this shrine was
apparently a marble cross. Near the north-west angle of the palace
was a larger bath chamber, and by the N. entrance were remains of
great reliefs of bull-hunting scenes in painted <i>gesso duro</i>. South of
the central court were found parts of a relief in the same material,
showing a personage with a fleur-de-lis crown and collar. The east
wing of the palace was the really residential part. Here was what
seems to have been the basement of a very large hall or &ldquo;Megaron,&rdquo;
approached directly from the central court, and near this were found
further reliefs, fresco representations of scenes of the bull-ring with
female as well as male toreadors, and remains of a magnificent
gaming-board of gold-plated ivory with intarsia work of crystal
plaques set on silver plates and blue enamel (<i>cyanus</i>). The true
domestic quarter lay to the south of the great hall, and was approached
from the central court by a descending staircase, of which three
flights and traces of a fourth are preserved. This gives access to
a whole series of halls and private rooms (halls &ldquo;of the Colonnades,&rdquo;
&ldquo;of the Double Axes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Megaron&rdquo; with bath-room attached
and remains of the fish fresco, &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; with ivory figures and
other objects of art), together with extensive remains of an upper
storey. The drainage system here, including a water-closet, is of the
most complete and modern kind. Near this domestic quarter was
found a small shrine of the Double Axes, with cult objects and
offertory vessels in their places. The traces of an earlier &ldquo;Middle
Minoan&rdquo; palace beneath the later floor-levels are most visible on
the east side, with splendid ceramic remains. Here also are early
magazines with huge store jars. At the foot of the slope on this side,
forming the eastern boundary of the palace, are massive supporting
walls and a bastion with descending flights of steps, and a water-channel
devised with extraordinary hydraulic science (Evans,
&ldquo;Palace of Knossos,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reports of Excavations 1900-1905,&rdquo; in
<i>Annual of British School at Athens</i>, vi. sqq.; <i>Journ. R.I.B.A.</i>
(1902), pt. iv. For the palace pottery see D. Mackenzie, <i>Journ. of
Hellenic Studies</i>, xxiii.). The palace site occupies nearly six acres.
To the N.E. of it came to light a &ldquo;royal villa&rdquo; with staircase, and a
basilica-like hall (Evans, <i>B.S. Annual</i>, ix. 130 seq.). To the N.W.
was a dependency containing an important hoard of bronze vessels
(ib. p. 112 sqq.). The building on the hill to the W. approached
by the Minoan paved way has the appearance of a smaller palace
(<i>B.S. Annual</i>, xii., 1906). Many remains of private houses belonging
to the prehistoric town have also come to light (Hogarth, <i>B.S.A.</i> vi.
[1900], p. 70 sqq.). A little N. of the town, at a spot called Zafer
Papoura, an extensive Late Minoan cemetery was excavated in
1904 (Evans, <i>The Prehistoric Tombs of Knossus</i>, 1906), and on a height
about 2 m. N. of this, a royal tomb consisting of a square chamber,
which originally had a pointed vault of &ldquo;Cyclopaean&rdquo; structure
approached by a forehall or rock-cut passage. This monumental
work seems to date from the close of the Middle Minoan age, but has
been re-used for interments at successive periods (Evans, <i>Archaeologia</i>,
1906, p. 136 sqq.). It is possibly the traditional tomb of
Idomeneus. (For later discoveries see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cnossus</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Phaestus.</i>&mdash;The acropolis of this historic city looks on the Libyan
Sea and commands the extensive plain of Messara. On the eastern
hill of the acropolis, excavations initiated by F. Halbherr on behalf
of the Italian Archaeological Mission and subsequently carried out
by L. Pernier have brought to light another Minoan palace, much
resembling on a somewhat smaller scale that of Cnossus. The plan
here too was roughly quadrangular with a central court, but owing
to the erosion of the hillside a good deal of the eastern quarter has
disappeared. The Phaestian palace belongs to two distinct periods,
and the earlier or &ldquo;Middle Minoan&rdquo; part is better preserved than
at Cnossus. The west court and entrance belonging to the earlier
building show many analogies with those of Cnossus, and the court
was commanded to the north by tiers of stone benches like those of
the &ldquo;theatral area&rdquo; at Cnossus on a larger scale. Magazines with
fine painted store jars came to light beneath the floor of the later
&ldquo;propylaeum.&rdquo; The most imposing block of the later building is
formed by a group of structures rising from the terrace formed by
the old west wall. A fine paved corridor running east from this gives
access to a line of the later magazines, and through a columnar hall
to the central court beyond, while to the left of this a broad and
stately flight of steps leads up to a kind of entrance hall on an upper
terrace. North of the central court is a domestic quarter presenting
analogies with that of Cnossus, but throughout the later building
there was a great dearth of the frescoes and other remains such as
invest the Cnossian palace with so much interest. There are also
few remaining traces here of upper storeys. It is evident that in this
case also the palace was overtaken by a great catastrophe, followed
by a partial reoccupation towards the close of the Late Minoan age
(L. Pernier, <i>Scavi della missione italiana a Phaestos; Monumenti
antichi</i>, xii. and xiv.).</p>

<p>About a kilometre distant from the palace of Phaestus near
the village of Kalyvia a Late Minoan cemetery was brought to light
in 1901, belonging to the same period as that of Cnossus (Savignoni,
<i>Necropoli di Phaestos</i>, 1905).</p>

<p><i>Hagia Triada.</i>&mdash;On a low hill crowned by a small church of the
above name, about 3 m. nearer the Libyan Sea than Phaestus, a
small palace or royal villa was discovered by Halbherr and excavated
by the Italian Mission. In its structure and general arrangements
it bears a general resemblance to the palace of Phaestus and Cnossus
on a smaller scale. The buildings themselves, with the usual halls,
bath-rooms and magazines, together with a shrine of the Mother
Goddess, occupy two sides of a rectangle, enclosing a court at a
higher level approached by flights of stairs. Repositories also came
to light containing treasure in the shape of bronze ingots. In contrast
to the palace of Phaestus, the contents of the royal villa proved
exceptionally rich, and derive a special interest from the fact that
the catastrophe which overwhelmed the building belongs to a
somewhat earlier part of the Late Minoan age than that which
overwhelmed Cnossus and Phaestus. Clay tablets were here found
belonging to the earlier type of the linear script (Class A), together
with a great number of clay sealings with religious and other devices
and incised countermarks. Both the signet types and the other
objects of art here discovered display the fresh naturalism that
characterizes in a special way the first Late Minoan period. A
remarkable wall-painting depicts a cat creeping over ivy-covered
rocks and about to spring on a pheasant. The steatite vases with
reliefs are of great importance. One of these shows a ritual procession,
apparently of reapers singing and dancing to the sound of
a sistrum. On another a Minoan warrior prince appears before his
retainers. A tall funnel-shaped vase of this class, of which a considerable
part has been preserved, is divided into zones showing
bull-hunting scenes, wrestlers and pugilists in gladiatorial costume,
the whole executed in a most masterly manner. The small palace
was reconstructed at a later period, and at a somewhat higher level.
To a period contemporary with the concluding age of the Cnossian
palace must be referred a remarkable sarcophagus belonging to a
neighbouring cemetery. The chest is of limestone coated with stucco,
adorned with life-like paintings of offertory scenes in connexion with
the sacred Double Axes of Minoan cult. There have also come to
light remains of a great domed mortuary chamber of primitive construction
containing relics of the Early Minoan period (Halbherr,
<i>Monumenti Antichi</i>, xiii. (1903), p. 6 sqq., and <i>Memorie del
instituto lombardo</i>, 1905; Paribeni, <i>Lavori eseguiti della missione
italiana nel Palazzo e nella necropoli di Haghia Triada; Rendiconti</i>,
&amp;c., xi. and xii.; Savignoni, <i>Il Vaso di Haghia Triada</i>).</p>

<p><i>Palaikastro.</i>&mdash;Near this village, lying on the easternmost coast of
Crete, the British School at Athens has excavated a section of a
considerable Minoan town. The buildings here show a stratification
analogous to that of the palace of Cnossus. The town was traversed
by a well-paved street with a stone sewer, and contained several
important private houses and a larger one which seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
a small palace. Among the more interesting relics found were ivory
figures of Egyptian or strongly Egyptianizing fabric. On an adjacent
hill were the remains of what seems to have been in later times
a temple of the Dictaean Zeus, and from the occurrence of rich
deposits of Minoan vases and sacrificial remains at a lower level, the
religious tradition represented by the later temple seems to go back
to prehistoric times. On the neighbouring height of Petsofà, by a
rock-shelter, remains of another interesting shrine were brought to
light dating from the Middle Minoan period, and containing interesting
votive offerings of terra-cotta, many of them apparently relating
to cures or to the warding off of diseases (R. C. Bosanquet, <i>British
School Annual</i>, viii. 286 sqq., ix. 274 sqq.; R. M. Dawkins, ibid.
ix. 290 sqq., x.; J. L. Myres, ibid. ix. 356 sqq.).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Gournia.</i>&mdash;Near this hamlet on the coast of the Gulf of Mirabello in
east Crete, the American archaeologist Miss Harriet Boyd has excavated
a great part of another Minoan town. It covers the sides of a long
hill, its main avenue being a winding roadway leading to a small
palace. It contained a shrine of the Cretan snake goddess, and was
rich in minor relics, chiefly in the shape of bronze implements and
pottery for household use. The bulk of the remains belong here, as
at Hagia Triada, to the beginning of the Late Minoan period, but
there are signs of reoccupation in the decadent Minoan age. The
remains supply detailed information as to the everyday life of a
Cretan country town about the middle of the second millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(H. Boyd, <i>Excavations at Gournia</i>).</p>

<p><i>Zakro.</i>&mdash;Near the lower hamlet of that name on the S.E. coast
important remains of a settlement contemporary with that of Gournia
were explored by D. G. Hogarth, consisting of houses and pits
containing painted pottery of exceptional beauty and a great variety
of seal impressions. The deep bay in which Zakro lies is a well-known
port of call for the fishing fleets on their way to the sponge grounds
of the Libyan coast, and doubtless stood in the same stead to the
Minoan shipping (D. G. Hogarth, <i>Annual of the British School</i>, vii. 121
sqq., and <i>Journ. of Hellenic Studies</i>, xxii. 76 sqq. and 333 sqq.).</p>

<p><i>Dictaean Cave.</i>&mdash;Near the village of Psychro on the Lassithi range,
answering to the western Dicte, opens a large cave, identified with
the legendary birthplace of the Cretan Zeus. This cavern also shared
with that of Ida the claim to have been that in which Minos, Moses-like,
received the law from Zeus. The exploration begun by the
Italian Mission under Halbherr and continued by Evans, who found
here the inscribed libation table (see above), was completed by
Hogarth in 1900. Besides the great entrance hall of the cavern,
which served as the upper shrine, were descending vaults forming a
lower sanctuary going down deep into the bowels of the earth. Great
quantities of votive figures and objects of cult, such as the fetish
double axes and stone tables of offering, were found both above and
below. In the lower sanctuary the natural pillars of stalagmite
had been used as objects of worship, and bronze votive objects
thrust into their crevices (Halbherr, <i>Museo di antichità classica</i>, ii.
pp. 906-910; Evans, <i>Further Discoveries</i>, &amp;c., p. 350 sqq., <i>Myc. Tree
and Pillar Cult</i>, p. 14 sqq.; Hogarth, &ldquo;The Dictaean Cave,&rdquo;
<i>Annual of British School at Athens</i>, vi. 94 sqq.).</p>

<p><i>Pseira and Mochlos.</i>&mdash;On these two islets on the northern coast
of E. Crete, R. Seager, an American explorer, has found striking
remains of flourishing Minoan settlements. The contents of a series
of tombs at Mochlos throw an entirely new light on the civilization of
the Early Minoan age.</p>
</div>

<p>The above summary gives, indeed, a very imperfect idea
of the extent to which the remains of the great Minoan civilization
are spread throughout the island. The &ldquo;hundred
cities&rdquo; ascribed to Crete by Homer are in a fair way
<span class="sidenote">Third Late Minoan period.</span>
of becoming an ascertained reality. The great days
of Crete lie thus beyond the historic period. The
period of decline referred to above (Late Minoan III.), which
begins about the beginning of the 14th century before our era,
must, from the abundance of its remains, have been of considerable
duration. As to the character of the invading elements that
hastened its close, and the date of their incursions, contemporary
Egyptian monuments afford the best clue. The Keftiu who
represented Minoan culture in Egypt in the concluding period
of the Cnossian palace (Late Minoan II.) cease to appear on
Egyptian monuments towards the end of the XVIIIth Dynasty
(c. 1350 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and their place is taken by the &ldquo;Peoples of the
Sea.&rdquo; The Achaeans, under the name <i>Akaiusha</i>, already appear
among the piratical invaders of Egypt in the time of Rameses
III. (c. 1200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) of the XXth Dynasty (see H. R. Hall,
&ldquo;Keftiu and the Peoples of the Sea,&rdquo; <i>Annual of British School
at Athens</i>, viii. 157 sqq.).</p>

<p>About the same time the evidences of imports of
Late Minoan or &ldquo;Mycenaean&rdquo; fabrics in Egypt
definitely cease. In the <i>Odyssey</i> we already find the
<span class="sidenote">Greek settlementsin Crete.</span>
Achaeans together with Dorians settled in central
Crete. In the extreme east and west of the island the aboriginal
&ldquo;Eteocretan&rdquo; element, however, as represented respectively
by the Praesians or Cydonians, still held its own, and inscriptions
written in Greek characters show that the old language survived
to the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era.</p>

<p>The mainland invasions which produced these great ethnic
changes in Crete are marked archaeologically by signs of widespread
destruction and by a considerable break in
the continuity of the insular civilization. New burial
<span class="sidenote">The dark ages.</span>
customs, notably the rite of cremation in place of the
older corpse-burial, are introduced, and in many cases the earlier
tombs were pillaged and re-used by new comers. The use of
iron for arms and implements now finally triumphed over
bronze. Northern forms of swords and safety-pins are now
found in general use. A new geometrical style of decoration
like that of contemporary Greece largely supplants the Minoan
models. The civic foundations which belong to this period,
and which include the greater part of the massive ruins of
Goulas and Anavlachos in the province of Mirabello and of
Hyrtakina in the west, affect more or less precipitous sites and
show a greater tendency to fortification. The old system of
writing now dies out, and it is not till some three centuries
later that the new alphabetic forms are introduced from a
Semitic source. The whole course of the older Cretan civilization
is awhile interrupted, and is separated from the new by the true
dark ages of Greece.</p>

<p>It is nevertheless certain that some of the old traditions were
preserved by the remnants of the old population now reduced
to a subject condition, and that these finally leavened the whole
lump, so that once more&mdash;this time under a Hellenic guise&mdash;Crete
was enabled to anticipate mainland Greece in nascent
civilization. Already in 1883 A. Milchhöfer (<i>Anfänge der
Kunst</i>) had called attention to certain remarkable examples
of archaic Greek bronze-work, and the subsequent discovery
of the votive bronzes in the cave of Zeus on Mount Ida, and
notably the shields with their fine embossed designs, shows that
by the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Cretan technique in metal not only held
its own beside imported Cypro-Phoenician work, but was distinctly
ahead of that of the rest of Greece (Halbherr, <i>Bronzi
del antro di Zeus Ideo</i>). The recent excavations by the British
School on the site of the Dictaean temple at Palaikastro bear
out this conclusion, and an archaic marble head of Apollo found
at Eleutherna shows that classical tradition was not at fault in
recording the existence of a very early school of Greek sculpture
in the island, illustrated by the names of Dipoenos and Scyllis.</p>

<p>The Dorian dynasts in Crete seem in some sort to have claimed
descent from Minos, and the Dorian legislators sought their
sanction in the laws which Minos was said to have received
from the hands of the Cretan Zeus. The great monument
of Gortyna discovered by Halbherr and Fabricius (<i>Monumenti
antichi</i>, iii.) is the most important monument of early law
hitherto brought to light in any part of the Greek world.</p>

<p>Among other Greek remains in the island may be mentioned,
besides the great inscription, the archaic temple of the Pythian
Apollo at Gortyna, a plain square building with a
<i>pronaos</i> added in later times, excavated by Halbherr,
<span class="sidenote">Greek remains.</span>
1885 and 1887 (<i>Mon. Ant.</i> iii. 2 seqq.), the Hellenic
bridge and the vast rock-cut reservoirs of Eleutherna, the city
walls of Itanos, Aptera and Polyrrhenia, and at Phalasarna, the
rock-cut throne of a divinity, the port, and the remains of a
temple. The most interesting record, however, that has been
preserved of later Hellenic civilization in the island is the
coinage of the Cretan cities (J. N. Svoronos, <i>Numismatique de
la Crete ancienne</i>; W. Wroth, <i>B. M. Coin Catalogue, Crete, &amp;c.</i>;
P. Gardner, <i>The Types of Greek Coins</i>), which during the good
period display a peculiarly picturesque artistic style distinct
from that of the rest of the Greek world, and sometimes indicative
of a revival of Minoan types. But in every case these artistic
efforts were followed at short intervals by gross relapses into
barbarism which reflect the anarchy of the political conditions.</p>

<p>Under the <i>Pax Romana</i>, the Cretan cities again enjoyed a
large measure of prosperity, illustrated by numerous edifices
still existing at the time of the Venetian occupation. A good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
account of these is preserved in a MS. description of the island
<span class="sidenote">Roman remains.</span>
drawn up under the Venetians about 1538, and existing in the
library of St Mark (published by Falkener, <i>Museum
of Classical Antiquities</i>, ii. pp. 263-303). Very little
of all this, however, has escaped the Turkish conquest
and the ravages caused by the incessant insurrections of the last
two centuries. The ruin-field of Gortyna still evokes something
of the importance that it possessed in Imperial days, and at
Lebena on the south coast are remains of a temple of Aesculapius
and its dependencies which stood in connexion with this city.
At Cnossus, save some blocks of the amphitheatre, the Roman
monuments visible in Venetian times have almost wholly
disappeared. Among the early Christian remains of the island
far and away the most important is the church of St Titus at
Gortyna, which perhaps dates from the Constantinian age.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature.</span>&mdash;See the authorities already quoted, for further
details. Previous to the extensive excavations referred to above,
Crete had been carefully examined and explored by Tournefort,
Pococke, Olivier and other travellers, <i>e.g.</i> Pashley (<i>Travels in Crete</i>,
2 vols., London, 1837) and Captain Spratt (<i>Travels and Researches
in Crete</i>, 2 vols., London, 1865). A survey sufficiently accurate as
regards the maritime parts was also executed, under the orders of
the British admiralty, by Captain Graves and Captain (afterwards
Admiral) Spratt. Most that can be gathered from ancient authors
concerning the mythology and early history of the island is brought
together by Meursius (<i>Creta</i>, &amp;c., in the 3rd vol. of his works) and
Hoeck (<i>Kreta</i>, 3 vols., Göttingen, 1823-1829), but the latter work
was published before the researches which have thrown so much
light on the topography and antiquities of the island. Much new
material, especially as to the western provinces of Crete, has been
recently collected by members of the Italian Archaeological Mission
(<i>Monumenti Antichi</i>, vol. vi. 154 seqq., ix. 286, 1899; xi. 286 seqq.).</p>
</div>
<div class="author">(A. J. E.)</div>

<p class="center pt2"><i>History.</i></p>

<p><i>Ancient.</i>&mdash;Lying midway between three continents, Crete
was from the earliest period a natural stepping-stone for the
passage of early culture from Egypt and the East to mainland
Greece. On all this the recent archaeological discoveries (see
the section on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archaeology</a></span>) have thrown great light, but the
earliest written history of Crete, like that of most parts of
continental Greece, is mixed up with mythology and fable to
so great an extent as to render it difficult to arrive at any clear
conclusions concerning it. The Cretans themselves claimed
for their island to be the birthplace of Zeus, as well as the parent
of all the other divinities usually worshipped in Greece as the
Olympian deities. But passing from this region of pure mythology
to the semi-mythic or heroic age, we find almost all the early
legends and traditions of the island grouped around the name
of Minos. According to the received tradition, Minos was a
king of Cnossus in Crete; he was a son of Zeus, and enjoyed
through life the privilege of habitual intercourse with his divine
father. It was from this source that he derived the wisdom
which enabled him to give to the Cretans the excellent system
of laws and governments that earned for him the reputation
of being the greatest legislator of antiquity. At the same time
he was reported to have been the first monarch who established
a naval power, and acquired what was termed by the Greeks
the <i>Thalassocracy</i>, or dominion of the sea.</p>

<p>This last tradition, which was received as an undoubted fact
both by Thucydides and Aristotle, has during the last few years
received striking confirmation. The remarkable remains recently
brought to light on Cretan soil tend to show that already some
2000 years before the Dorian conquest the island was exercising a
dominant influence in the Aegean world. The great palaces now
excavated at Cnossus and Phaestus, as well as the royal villa
of Hagia Triada, exhibit the successive phases of a brilliant primitive
civilization which had already attained mature development
by the date of the XIIth Egyptian dynasty. To this civilization
as a whole it is convenient to give the name &ldquo;Minoan,&rdquo; and
the name of Minos itself may be reasonably thought to cover
a dynastic even more than a personal significance in much the
same way as such historic terms as &ldquo;Pharaoh&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caesar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The archaeological evidence outside Crete points to the actual
existence of Minoan plantations as far afield on one side as
Sicily and on the other as the coast of Canaan. The historic
tradition which identifies with the Cretans the principal element
of the Philistine confederation, and places the tomb of Minos
himself in western Sicily, thus receives remarkable confirmation.
Industrial relations with Egypt are also marked by the occurrence
of a series of finds of pottery and other objects of Minoan fabric
among the remains of the XVIIIth, XIIth and even earlier
dynasties, while the same seafaring enterprise brought Egyptian
fabrics to Crete from the times of the first Pharaohs. Even in the
Homeric poems, which belong to an age when the great Minoan
civilization was already decadent, the Cretans appear as the only
Greek people who attempted to compete with the Phoenicians
as bold and adventurous navigators. In the Homeric age the
population of Crete was of a very mixed character, and we are
told in the <i>Odyssey</i> (xix. 175) that besides the Eteocretes, who,
as their name imports, must have been the original inhabitants,
the island contained Achaeans, Pelasgians and Dorians. Subsequently
the Dorian element became greatly strengthened by
fresh immigrations from the Peloponnesus, and during the
historical period all the principal cities of the island were either
Dorian colonies, or had adopted the Dorian dialect and
institutions. It is certain that at a very early period the Cretan
cities were celebrated for their laws and system of government,
and the most extensive monument of early Greek law is the
great Gortyna inscription, discovered in 1884. The origin of the
Cretan laws was of course attributed to Minos, but they
had much in common with those of the other Dorian states, as
well as with those of Lycurgus at Sparta, which were, indeed,
according to one tradition, copied in great measure from those
already existing in Crete.<a name="FnAnchor_2m" id="FnAnchor_2m" href="#Footnote_2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>It is certain that whatever merits the Cretan laws may have
possessed for the internal regulation of the different cities, they
had the one glaring defect, that they made no provision for any
federal bond or union among them, or for the government of the
island as a whole. It was owing to the want of this that the
Cretans scarcely figure in Greek history as a people, though the
island, as observed by Aristotle, would seem from its natural
position calculated to exercise a preponderating influence over
Greek affairs. Thus they took no part either in the Persian or in
the Peloponnesian War, or in any of the subsequent civil contests
in which so many of the cities and islands of Greece were engaged.
At the same time they were so far from enjoying tranquillity on
this account that the few notices we find of them in history always
represent them as engaged in local wars among one another; and
Polybius tells us that the history of Crete was one continued
series of civil wars, which were carried on with a bitter animosity
exceeding all that was known in the rest of Greece.</p>

<p>In these domestic contests the three cities that generally took
the lead, and claimed to exercise a kind of <i>hegemony</i> or supremacy
over the whole island, were Cnossus, Gortyna and Cydonia.
But besides these three, there were many other independent
cities, which, though they generally followed the lead of one or
other of these more powerful rivals, enjoyed complete autonomy,
and were able to shift at will from one alliance to another. Among
the most important of these were&mdash;Lyttus or Lyctus, in the
interior, south-east of Cnossus; Rhaucus, between Cnossus and
Gortyna; Phaestus, in the plain of Messara, between Gortyna
and the sea; Polyrrhenia, near the north-west angle of the
island; Aptera, a few miles inland from the Bay of Suda;
Eleutherna and Axus, on the northern slopes of Mount Ida; and
Lappa, between the White Mountains and the sea. Phalasarna
on the west coast, and Chersonesus on the north, seem to have
been dependencies, and served as the ports of Polyrrhenia and
Lyttus. Elyrus stood at the foot of the White Mountains just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
above the south coast. In the eastern portion of the island were
Praesus in the interior, and Itanus on the coast, facing the east,
while Hierapytna on the south coast was the only place of
importance on the side facing Africa, and on this account
rose under the Romans to be one of the principal cities of the
island.</p>
<div class="author">(A. J. E.)</div>

<p><i>Medieval to 19th Century.</i>&mdash;Though it was continually torn by
civil dissensions, the island maintained its independence of the
various Macedonian monarchs by whom it was surrounded; but
having incurred the enmity of Rome, first by an alliance with the
great Mithradates, and afterwards by taking active part with
their neighbours, the pirates of Cilicia, the Cretans were at length
attacked by the Roman arms, and, after a resistance protracted
for more than three years, were finally subdued by Q. Metellus,
who earned by this success the surname of Creticus (67 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The
island was now reduced to a Roman province, and subsequently
united for administrative purposes with the district of Cyrenaica
or the Pentapolis, on the opposite coast of Africa. This arrangement
lasted till the time of Constantine, by whom Crete was
incorporated in the prefecture of Illyria. It continued to form
part of the Byzantine empire till the 9th century, when it fell
into the hands of the Saracens (823). It then became a formidable
nest of pirates and a great slave mart; it defied all the efforts of
the Byzantine sovereigns to recover it till the year 960, when it
was reconquered by Nicephorus Phocas. In the partition of the
Greek empire after the capture of Constantinople by the Latins
in 1204, Crete fell to the lot of Boniface, marquis of Montferrat,
but was sold by him to the Venetians, and thus passed under the
dominion of that great republic, to which it continued subject for
more than four centuries.</p>

<p>Under the Venetian government Candia, a fortress originally
built by the Saracens, and called by them &ldquo;Khandax,&rdquo; became
the seat of government, and not only rose to be the capital and
chief city of the island, but actually gave name to it, so that it
was called in the official language of Venice &ldquo;the island of
Candia,&rdquo; a designation which from thence passed into modern
maps. The ancient name of Krete or Kriti was, however, always
retained in use among the Greeks, and is gradually resuming its
place in the usage of literary Europe. The government of Crete
by the Venetian aristocracy was, like that of their other dependencies,
very arbitrary and oppressive, and numerous
insurrections were the consequence. Daru, in his history of
Venice, mentions fourteen between the years 1207 and 1365, the
most important being that of 1361-1364,&mdash;a revolt not of the
natives against the rule of their Venetian masters, but of the
Venetian colonists against the republic. But with all its defects
their administration did much to promote the material prosperity
of the country, and to encourage commerce and industry; and it
is probable that the island was more prosperous than at any
subsequent time. Their Venetian masters at least secured to the
islanders external tranquillity, and it is singular that the Turks
were content to leave them in undisturbed possession of this
opulent and important island for nearly two centuries after the
fall of Constantinople. The Cretans themselves, however, were
eager for a change, and, disappointed in the hope of a Genoese
occupation, were ready, as is stated in the report of a Venetian
commissioner, to exchange the rule of the Venetians for that of
the Turks, whom they fondly expected to find more lenient, or at
any rate less energetic, masters. It was not till 1645 that the
Turks made any serious attempt to effect the conquest of the
island; but in that year they landed with an army of 50,000 men,
and speedily reduced the important city of Canea. Retimo fell the
following year, and in 1648 they laid siege to the capital city of
Candia. This was the longest siege on record, having been
protracted for more than twenty years; but in 1667 it was
pressed with renewed vigour by the Turks under the grand
vizier Ahmed Kuprili, and the city was at length compelled
to surrender (September 1669). Its fall was followed by the
submission of the whole island. Venice was allowed to retain
possession of Grabusa, Suda and Spinalonga on the north, but in
1718 these three strongholds reverted to the Turks, and the
island was finally lost to Venice.</p>

<p>From this time Crete continued subject to Ottoman rule
without interruption till the outbreak of the Greek revolution.
After the conquest a large part of the inhabitants embraced
Mahommedanism, and thus secured to themselves the chief share
in the administration of the island. But far from this having a
favourable effect upon the condition of the population, the result
was just the contrary, and according to R. Pashley (<i>Travels in
Crete</i>, 1837) Crete was the worst governed province of the Turkish
empire. In 1770 an abortive attempt at revolt, the hero of
which was &ldquo;Master&rdquo; John, a Sphakiot chief, was repressed with
great cruelty. The regular authorities sent from Constantinople
were wholly unable to control the excesses of the janissaries, who
exercised without restraint every kind of violence and oppression.
In 1813 the ruthless severity of the governor-general, Haji
Osman, who obtained the co-operation of the Christians, broke
the power of the janissaries; but after Osman had fallen a victim
to the suspicions of the sultan, Crete again came under their
control. When in 1821 the revolution broke out in continental
Greece, the Cretans, headed by the Sphakiots, after a massacre at
Canea at once raised the standard of insurrection. They carried
on hostilities with such success that they soon made themselves
masters of the whole of the open country, and drove the Turks
and Mussulman population to take refuge in the fortified cities.
The sultan then invoked the assistance of Mehemet Ali, pasha of
Egypt, who despatched 7000 Albanians to the island. Hostilities
continued with no decisive result till 1824, when the arrival of
further reinforcements enabled the Turkish commander to
reduce the island to submission. In 1827 the battle of Navarino
took place, and in 1830 (3rd of February) Greece was declared
independent. The allied powers (France, England and Russia)
decided, however, that Crete should not be included amongst the
islands annexed to the newly-formed kingdom of Greece; but
recognizing that some change was necessary, they obtained from
the sultan Mahmud II. its cession to Egypt, which was confirmed
by a firman of the 20th of December 1832. This change
of masters brought some relief to the unfortunate Cretans, who
at least exchanged the licence of local misrule for the oppression
of an organized despotism; and the government of Mustafa
Pasha, an Albanian like Mehemet Ali, the ruler of the island for
a considerable period (1832-1852), was more enlightened and
intelligent than that of most Turkish governors. He encouraged
agriculture, improved the roads, introduced an Albanian police,
and put down brigandage. The period of his administration
has been called the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of Crete.</p>

<p>In 1840 Crete was again taken from Mehemet Ali, and replaced
under the dominion of the Turks, but fortunately Mustafa still
retained his governorship until he left for Constantinople to
become grand vizier in 1852. Four years later an insurrection
broke out, owing to the violation of the provisions of an imperial
decree (February 1856), whereby liberty of conscience and
equal rights and privileges with Mussulmans had been conferred
upon Christians. The latter refused to lay down their arms until
a firman was issued (July 1858), confirming the promised concessions.
These promises being again repudiated, in 1864 the
inhabitants held an assembly and a petition was drawn up for
presentation at Constantinople by the governor. The sultan&rsquo;s
reply was couched in the vaguest terms, and the Cretans were
ordered to render unquestioning obedience to the authorities.
After a period of great distress and cruel oppression, in 1866,
on the demand for reforms being again refused, a general insurrection
took place, which was only put down by great exertions
on the part of the Porte. It was followed by the concession of
additional privileges to the Christians of the island and of a kind
of constitutional government and other reforms embodied in
what is known as the &ldquo;Organic Statute&rdquo; of 1868.</p>
<div class="author">(J. H. F.)</div>

<p><i>Modern Constitutional.</i>&mdash;Cretan constitutional history may be
said to date from 1868, when, after the suppression of an insurrection
which had extended over three years, the Turkish government
consented to grant a certain measure of autonomy to the
island. The privileges now accorded were embodied in what is
known as the Organic Statute, an instrument which eventually
obtained a somewhat wider importance, being proposed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
Article XXIII. of the Berlin Treaty as a basis of reforms to be
introduced in other parts of the Ottoman empire. Various
privileges already acquired by the Christian population were
confirmed; a general council, or representative body, was
brought into existence, composed of deputies from every district
in the island; mixed tribunals were introduced, together with
a highly elaborate administrative system, under which all the
more important functionaries, Christian and Mussulman, were
provided with an assessor of the opposite creed. The new
constitution, however, proved costly and unworkable, and failed
to satisfy either section of the population. The Christians were
ready for another outbreak, when, in 1878, the Greek government,
finding Hellenic aspirations ignored by the treaty of San Stefano,
gave the signal for agitation in the island. During the insurrection
which followed, the usual barbarities were committed on both
sides; the Christians betook themselves to the mountains, and
the Mussulman peasants crowded into the fortified towns.
Eventually the Cretan chiefs invoked the mediation of England,
which Turkey, exhausted by her struggle with Russia, was
<span class="sidenote">Pact of Halepa.</span>
ready to accept, and the convention known as the
Pact of Halepa was drawn up in 1878 under the auspices
of Mr Sandwith, the British consul, and Adossides
Pasha, both of whom enjoyed the confidence of the Cretan
population. The privileges conferred by the Organic Statute
were confirmed; the cumbersome and extravagant judicial and
administrative systems were maintained; the judges were
declared independent of the executive, and an Assembly composed
of forty-nine Christian and thirty-one Mussulman deputies
took the place of the former general council. A parliamentary
régime was thus inaugurated, and party warfare for a time took
the place of the old religious antagonism, the Moslems attaching
themselves to one or other of the political factions which now
made their appearance among the Christians. The material
interests of the island were neglected in the scramble for place and
power; the finances fell into disorder, and the party which came
off worst in the struggle systematically intrigued against the
governor-general of the day and conspired with his enemies at
Constantinople. A crisis came about in 1889, when the &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo;
leaders, finding themselves in a minority in the
chamber, took up arms and withdrew to the mountains. Though
the outbreak was unconnected with the religious feud, the latent
fanaticism of both creeds was soon aroused, and the island once
more became a scene of pillage and devastation. Unlike the two
preceding movements, the insurrection of 1889 resulted unfavourably
for the Christians. The Porte, having induced the Greek
government to persuade the insurgents not to oppose the occupation
of several strategic posts, despatched a military governor
to the island, proclaimed martial law, and issued a firman
abrogating many important provisions of the Halepa Pact.
The mode of election to the assembly was altered, the number
of its members reduced, and the customs revenue, which had
hitherto been shared with the island, was appropriated by the
Turkish treasury. The firman was undoubtedly illegal, as it
violated a convention possessing a quasi-international sanction,
but the Christians were unable to resist, and the powers abstained
from intervention. The elections held under the new system
proved a failure, the Christians refusing to go to the polls, and
for the next five years Crete was governed absolutely by a succession
of Mahommedan Valis. The situation went from bad to
worse, the deficit in the budget increased, the gendarmery, which
received no pay, became insubordinate, and crime multiplied.
In 1894 the Porte, at the instance of the powers, nominated a
Christian, Karatheodory Pasha, to the governorship, and the
Christians, mollified by the concession, agreed to take part in
the assembly which soon afterwards was convoked; no steps,
however, were taken to remedy the financial situation, which
became the immediate cause of the disorders that followed. The
refusal of the Porte to refund considerable sums which had been
illegally diverted from the Cretan treasury or even to sanction
a loan to meet immediate requirements caused no little exasperation
in the island, which was increased by the recall of Karatheodory
(March 1895). Before that event an Epitropé, or
&ldquo;Committee of Reform,&rdquo; had appeared in the mountains&mdash;the
harbinger of the prolonged struggle which ended in the emancipation
<span class="sidenote">Insurrection of 1896-97.</span>
of Crete. The Epitropé was at first nothing
more than a handful of discontented politicians who had
failed to find places in the administration, but some
slight reverses which it succeeded in inflicting on the
Turkish troops brought thousands of armed Christians to its
side, and in April 1896 it found itself strong enough to invest
the important garrison town of Vamos. The Moslem peasantry
now flocked to the fortified towns and civil war began. Serious
disturbances broke out at Canea on the 24th of May, and were
only quelled by the arrival of foreign warships. The foreign
consuls intervened in the hope of bringing about a peaceful
settlement, but the Sultan resolved on the employment of force,
and an expedition despatched to Vamos effected the relief of that
town with a loss of 200 men. The advance of a Turkish detachment
through the western districts, where other garrisons were
besieged, was marked by pillage and devastation, and 5000
Christian peasants took refuge on the desolate promontory of
Spada, where they suffered extreme privations. These events,
which produced much excitement in Greece, quickened the
energies of the powers. An international blockade of the island
was proposed by Austria but rejected by England. The
ambassadors at Constantinople urged peaceful counsels on the
Porte, and the Sultan, alarmed at this juncture by an Armenian
outbreak, began to display a conciliatory disposition. The Pact
of Halepa was restored, the troops were withdrawn from the
interior, financial aid was promised to the island, a Christian
governor-general was appointed, the assembly was summoned,
and an imperial commissioner was despatched to negotiate an
arrangement. The Christian leaders prepared a moderate
scheme of reforms, based on the Halepa Pact, which, with a
few exceptions, were approved by the powers and eventually
sanctioned by the sultan.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September 1896 the assembly formally accepted
the new constitution and declared its gratitude to the powers
for their intervention. The Moslem leaders acquiesced in the
arrangement, which the powers undertook to guarantee, and,
notwithstanding some symptoms of discontent at Candia,
there was every reason to hope that the island was now entering
upon a period of tranquillity. It soon became evident, however,
that the Porte was endeavouring to obstruct the execution of the
new reforms. Several months passed without any step being
taken towards this realization; difficulties were raised with
regard to the composition of the international commissions
charged with the reorganization of the gendarmery and judicial
system; intrigues were set on foot against the Christian governor-general;
and the presence of a special imperial commissioner,
who had no place under the constitution, proved so injurious
to the restoration of tranquillity that the powers demanded his
immediate recall. The indignation of the Christians increased,
a state of insecurity prevailed, and the Moslem peasants refused
to return to their homes. A new factor now became apparent
in Cretan politics. Since the outbreak in May 1896 the Greek
government had loyally co-operated with the powers in their
efforts for the pacification of the island, but towards the close of
the year a secret society known as the Ethniké Hetaeria began to
arrogate to itself the direction of Greek foreign policy. The aim
of the society was a war with Turkey with a view to the acquisition
of Macedonia, and it found a ready instrument for its
designs in the growing discontent of the Cretan Christians.
Emissaries of the society now appeared in Crete, large consignments
of arms were landed, and at the beginning of 1897 the
<span class="sidenote">Greek Intervention.</span>
island was practically in a state of insurrection. On
the 21st of January the Greek fleet was mobilized.
Affairs were brought to a climax by a series of conflicts
which took place at Canea on the 4th of February;
the Turkish troops fired on the Christians, a conflagration broke
out in the town, and many thousands of Christians took refuge
on the foreign warships in the bay. The Greek government now
despatched an ironclad and a cruiser to Canea, which were
followed a few days later by a torpedo flotilla commanded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
Prince George. The prince soon retired to Melos, but on the night
of the 14th of February a Greek expeditionary force under
Colonel Vassos landed at Kolymbari, near Canea, and its commander
issued a proclamation announcing the occupation of the
island in the name of King George. On the same day Georgi
Pasha, the Christian governor-general, took refuge on board a
Russian ironclad, and, on the next, naval detachments from
the warships of the powers occupied Canea. This step paralysed
the movements of Colonel Vassos, who after a few slight engagements
with the Turks remained practically inactive in the interior.
The insurgents, however, continued to threaten the town, and
their position was bombarded by the international fleet (21st
February). The intervention of Greece caused immense excitement
among the Christian population, and terrible massacres of
Moslem peasants took place in the eastern and western districts.
The forces of the powers shortly afterwards occupied Candia
and the other maritime towns, while the international fleet
blockaded the Cretan coast. These measures were followed by
the presentation of collective notes to the Greek and
<span class="sidenote">Decision of the powers.</span>
Turkish governments (2nd March), announcing the
decision of the powers that (1) Crete could in no case
in present circumstances be annexed to Greece; (2)
in view of the delays caused by Turkey in the application of the
reforms Crete should now be endowed with an effective autonomous
administration, intended to secure to it a separate
government, under the suzerainty of the sultan. Greece was at
the same time summoned to remove its army and fleet from the
island, while the Turkish troops were to be concentrated in the
fortresses and eventually withdrawn. The cabinet of Athens,
however, declined to recall the expeditionary force, which
remained in the interior till the 9th of May, when, after the Greek
reverses in Thessaly and Epirus, an order was given for its return.
Meantime Cretan autonomy had been proclaimed (20th March).
After the departure of the Greek troops the Cretan leaders, who
had hitherto demanded annexation to Greece, readily acquiesced
in the decision of the powers, and the insurgent Assembly, under
its president Dr Sphakianakis, a man of good sense and moderation,
co-operated with the international commanders in the
maintenance of order. The pacification of the island, however,
was delayed by the presence of the Turkish troops and the inability
of the powers to agree in the choice of a new governor-general.
The prospect of a final settlement was improved by the
withdrawal of Germany and Austria, which had favoured Turkish
pretensions, from the European concert (April 1898); the remaining
powers divided the island into four departments, which
they severally undertook to administer. An attack made by the
Moslems of Candia on the British garrison of that town, with
the connivance of the Turkish authorities, brought home to the
powers the necessity of removing the Ottoman troops, and the
last Turkish soldiers quitted the island on the 14th of November
1898.</p>

<p>On the 26th of that month the nomination of Prince George
of Greece as high commissioner of the powers in Crete for a
period of three years (renewed in 1901) was formally
announced, and on the 21st of December the prince
<span class="sidenote">Prince George&rsquo;s administration.</span>
landed at Suda and made his public entry into Canea
amid enthusiastic demonstrations. For some time
after his arrival complete tranquillity prevailed in the island,
but the Moslem population, reduced to great distress by the
prolonged insurrection, emigrated in large numbers. On the
27th of April 1899 a new autonomous constitution was voted
by a constituent assembly, and in the following June the local
administration was handed over to Cretan officials by the international
authorities. The extensive powers conferred by the
constitution upon Prince George were increased by subsequent
enactments. In 1901 M. Venezelo, who had played a noteworthy
part in the last insurrection, was dismissed from the post of
councillor by the prince, and soon afterwards became leader of a
strong opposition party, which denounced the arbitrary methods
of the government. During the next four years party spirit ran
high; in the spring of 1904 a deputation of chiefs and politicians
addressed a protest to the prince, and early in the following
year a band of armed malcontents under M. Venezelo raised the
standard of revolt at Theriso in the White Mountains. The
insurgents, who received moral support from Dr Sphakianakis,
proclaimed the union of the island with Greece (March 1905),
and their example was speedily followed by the assembly at
Canea. The powers, however, reiterated their decision to maintain
the <i>status quo</i>, and increased their military and naval
forces; the Greek flag was hauled down at Canea and Candia,
and some desultory engagements with the insurgents took place,
the international troops co-operating with the native gendarmerie.
In the autumn M. Venezelo and his followers, having obtained
an amnesty, laid down their arms. A commission appointed
by the powers to report on the administrative and financial
situation drew up a series of recommendations in January 1906,
and a constituent assembly for the revision of the constitution
met at Canea in the following June. On the 25th of July the
powers announced a series of reforms, including the reorganization
of the gendarmerie and militia under Greek officers, as a
preliminary to the eventual withdrawal of the international
troops, and the extension to Crete of the system of financial
control established in Greece. On the 14th of September, under
an agreement dated the 14th of August, they invited King
George of Greece, in the event of the high commissionership
becoming vacant, to propose a candidate for that post, to be
nominated by the powers for a period of five years, and on the
25th of September Prince George left the island. He had done
much for the welfare of Crete, but his participation in party
struggles and his attitude towards the representatives of the
powers had rendered his position untenable. His successor,
M. Alexander Zaimis, a former prime minister of Greece, arrived
in Crete on the 1st of October.</p>
<div class="author">(J. D. B.)</div>

<p>On the 22nd of February 1907 M. Zaimis, as high commissioner,
took the oath to the new constitution elaborated after much
debate by the Cretan national assembly. His position was one
of singular difficulty. Apart from the rivalry of the factions
within the Assembly, there was the question of the Mussulman
minority, dwindling it is true,<a name="FnAnchor_3m" id="FnAnchor_3m" href="#Footnote_3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> but still a force to be reckoned
with. The high commissioner, true to his reputation as a prudent
statesman and astute politician, showed great skill in dealing
with the situation. From the first he had taken up an attitude
of great reserve, appearing little in public and careful not to
identify himself with any faction. In such matters as appointments
to the judicial bench, indeed, his studied impartiality
offended both parties; but on the whole his administration was
a marked success, and the cessation of the chronic state of disturbance
in the island justified the powers in preparing for the
withdrawal of their troops. In spite of the admission of their
co-religionists to high office in the government, the Mussulmans,
it is true, still complained of continuous ill-treatment having
for its object their expatriation; but these complaints were
declared by Sir Edward Grey, in answer to a question in parliament,
to be exaggerated. The protecting powers had fixed the
conditions preliminary to evacuation&mdash;(1) the organization of a
native gendarmerie, (2) the maintenance of the tranquillity
of the island, (3) the complete security of the Mussulman population.
On the 20th of March 1908 M. Zaimis called the attention
of the powers to the fact that these conditions had been fulfilled,
and on the 11th of May the powers announced to the high
commissioner their intention of beginning the evacuation at once
and completing it within a year. The first withdrawal of the
troops (July 27), hailed with enthusiasm by the Cretan Christians,
led to rioting by the Mussulmans, who believed themselves
abandoned to their fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile M. Zaimis had made a further advance towards the
annexation of the island to Greece by a visit to Athens, where
he arranged for a loan with the Greek National Bank and engaged
Greek officers for the new gendarmerie. The issue was precipitated
by the news of the revolution in Turkey. On the 12th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
of October the Cretan Assembly once more voted the union with
Greece, and in the absence of M. Zaimis&mdash;who had gone for a
holiday to Santa Maura&mdash;elected a committee of six to govern
the island in the name of the king of Greece.</p>

<p>Against this the Mussulman deputies protested, in a memorandum
addressed to the British secretary of state for foreign
affairs. His reply, while stating that his government would
safeguard the interests of the Mussulmans, left open the question
of the attitude of the powers, complicated now by sympathy
with reformed Turkey. The efforts of diplomacy were directed
to allaying the resentment of the &ldquo;Young Turks&rdquo; on the one
hand and the ardour of the Greek unionists on the other; and
meanwhile the Cretan administration was carried on peaceably
in the name of King George. At last (July 13, 1909) the powers
announced to the Porte, in answer to a formal remonstrance,
their decision to withdraw their remaining troops from Crete
by July 26 and to station four war-ships off the island to protect
the Moslems and to safeguard &ldquo;the supreme rights&rdquo; of the
Ottoman Empire. This arrangement, which was duly carried
out, was avowedly &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; and satisfied neither party,
leading in Greece especially to the military and constitutional
crises of 1909 and 1910.</p>

the Cretan system, like that of Sparta, appears to have aimed at
training up the young, and controlling them, as well as the citizens
of more mature age, in all their habits and relations of life. The
supreme governing authority was vested in magistrates called Cosmi,
answering in some measure to the Spartan Ephori, but there was

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRETINISM,<a name="ar244" id="ar244"></a></span> the term given to a chronic disease, either
sporadic or endemic, arising in early childhood, and due to
absence or deficiency of the normal secretion of the thyroid
gland. It is characterized by imperfect development both of
mind and body. The thyroid gland is either congenitally absent,
imperfectly developed, or there is definite goitre. The origin
of the word is doubtful. Its southern French form <i>Chrestiaa</i>
suggested to Michel a derivation from <i>cresta</i> (<i>crête</i>), the goose foot
of red cloth worn by the Cagots of the Pyrenees. The Cagots,
however, were not cretins. The word is usually explained as
derived from <i>chrétien</i> (Christian) in the sense of &ldquo;innocent.&rdquo;
But <i>Christianus</i> (which appears in the Lombard <i>cristanei</i>;
compare the Savoyard <i>innocents</i> and <i>gens du bon dieu</i>) is probably
a translation of the older <i>cretin</i>, and the latter is probably
connected with <i>creta</i> (<i>craie</i>)&mdash;a sallow or yellow-earthy complexion
being a common mark of cretinism.</p>

<p>The endemic form of cretinism prevails in certain districts,
as in the valleys of central Switzerland, Tirol and the Pyrenees.
In the United Kingdom cretins have been found in England at
Oldham, Sholver Moor, Crompton, Duffield, Cromford (near
Matlock), and other points in Derbyshire; endemic goitre has
been seen near Nottingham, Chesterfield, Pontefract, Ripon, and
the mountainous parts of Staffordshire and Yorkshire, the east
of Cumberland, certain parts of Worcester, Warwick, Cheshire,
Monmouth, and Leicester, near Horsham in Hampshire, near
Haslemere in Surrey, and near Beaconsfield in Buckingham.
There are cretins at Chiselborough in Somerset. In Scotland
cretins and cases of goitre have been seen in Perthshire, on the
east coast of Fife, in Roxburgh, the upper portions of Peebles
and Selkirk, near Lanark and Dumfries, in the east of Ayrshire,
in the west of Berwick, the east of Wigtown, and in Kirkcudbright.
The disease is not confined to Europe, but occurs in North and
South America, Australia, Africa and Asia. Wherever endemic
goitre is present, endemic cretinism is present also, and it has
been constantly observed that when a new family moves into a
goitrous district, goitre appears in the first generation, cretinism
in the second. The causation of goitre has now been shown to
be due to drinking certain waters, though the particular impurity
in the water which gives rise to this condition has not been
determined (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Goitre</a></span>). The causation of the sporadic form
of cretinism is, however, obscure.</p>

<p>Cretinism usually remains unrecognized until the child reaches
some eighteen months or two years, when its lack of mental
development and uncouth bodily form begin to attract attention.
Occasionally the child appears to be normal in infancy, but the
cretinoid condition develops later, any time up to puberty. The
essential point in the morbid anatomy of these cases is the absence
or abnormal condition of the thyroid gland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metabolic
Diseases</a></span>). It may be congenitally absent, atrophied, or the
seat of a goitre, though this last condition is very rare in cases
of sporadic cretinism. The skeleton shows arrested growth,
most marked in the case of the long bones. The skull in the
endemic form of cretinism is usually brachycephalic, but in
the sporadic cases it is more commonly dolichocephalic. The
pathology of cretinism and its allied condition myxoedema (<i>q.v.</i>)
has now been conclusively worked out, and its essential cause
has been shown to be loss of function of the thyroid gland.</p>

<p>The condition has existed and been described in far back
ages, but mingled with so many other entirely different deformities
and degenerations that it is now often almost impossible
to classify them satisfactorily. The following is a vivid picture
by Beaupré (<i>Dissertation sur les crétins</i>, translated in Blackie
on <i>Cretinism</i>, Edin., 1855):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;I see a head of unusual form and size, a squat and bloated
figure, a stupid look, bleared hollow and heavy eyes, thick projecting
eyelids, and a flat nose. His face is of a leaden hue, his skin dirty,
flabby, covered with tetters, and his thick tongue hangs down over
his moist livid lips. His mouth, always open and full of saliva,
shows teeth going to decay. His chest is narrow, his back curved,
his breath asthmatic, his limbs short, misshapen, without power.
The knees are thick and inclined inward, the feet flat. The large
head drops listlessly on the breast; the abdomen is like a bag.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>When fully grown the height rarely exceeds 4 ft., and is often
less than 3 ft. The skin feels doughy from thickening of the subcutaneous
tissues, and it hangs in folds over the abdomen and
the bends of the joints. Very frequently there is an umbilical
hernia. The hair has a far greater resemblance to horse-hair
than to that of a human being, and is usually absent on the body
of an adult cretin. The temperature is subnormal, and the
exposed parts tend to become blue in cold weather. The blood
is usually deficient in haemoglobin, which is often only 40-50%
of the normal. The mental capacity varies within narrow limits;
an intelligent adult cretin may reach the intellectual development
of a child 3-4 years of age, though more often the standard
attained is even below this. The child cretin learns neither
to walk nor talk at the usual time. Often it is unable even to
sit without support. Some years later a certain power of movement
is acquired, but the gait is waddling and clumsy. Speech
is long delayed, or in bad cases may be almost entirely lacking.
The voice is usually harsh and unpleasant. Of the senses smell
and taste are but slightly developed, more or less deafness is
generally present, and only the sight is fairly normal. In the
adult the genital organs remain undeveloped. If the cretin
is untreated he rarely has a long life, thirty years being an
exceptional age. Death results from some intercurrent disease.</p>

<p>Cretinism has to be distinguished from the state of a Mongolian
idiot, in whom there is no thickening of the subcutaneous tissues,
and much greater alertness of mind; from achondroplasia, in
which condition there is usually no mental impairment; and
from infantilism, which covers a group of symptoms whose only
common point is that the primary and secondary sexual
characteristics fail to appear at the proper time.</p>

<p>Before 1891 there was no treatment for this disease. The
patients lived in hopeless imbecility until their death. But in
that year Dr George Murray published his discovery of the
effect of hypodermic injections of thyroid gland extract in
cases of myxoedema. In the following year Drs Hector Mackenzie,
E. L. Fox of Plymouth, and Howitz of Copenhagen,
each working independently, showed the equally potent effect
of the gland administered by the mouth. The remedy was soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
after applied to cretinism and its effects were found to be even
more wonderful. It has to be used, however, with the greatest
care and discrimination, since personal idiosyncrasy seems to
be a very variable factor. Even small doses, if beyond the
patient&rsquo;s power, may produce fever, excitement, headache,
insomnia and vomiting. The administration must be persisted
in throughout life, otherwise myxoedematous symptoms appear.
The first most apparent results are those of growth, and this
may supervene even in patients up to 25-30 years of age. Once
started, 4 to 6 in. may be gained in stature in the first year&rsquo;s
treatment, though this is usually in inverse ratio to the age of
the patient, and also diminishes in later stages of treatment.
In young adolescents it may be so rapid that the patient has to
be kept lying down to prevent permanent bending of the long
bones of the leg, softened by their rapid growth. A very typical
case under Dr Hector Mackenzie, showing what can be expected
from early treatment, is that of a cretin aged 11 years in 1893,
when thyroid treatment was started. He grew very rapidly
and became a normal child, passed through school, and in 1908
was at one of the universities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRETONNE,<a name="ar245" id="ar245"></a></span> originally a strong, white fabric with a hempen
warp and linen weft. The word is said to be derived from Creton,
a village in Normandy where the manufacture of linen was
carried on. It is now applied to a strong, printed cotton cloth,
stouter than chintz but used for very much the same purposes. It
is usually unglazed and may be printed on both sides and even
with different patterns. Frequently the cretonne has a woven
fancy pattern of some kind which is modified by the printed

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CREUSE,<a name="ar246" id="ar246"></a></span> a department of central France, comprising the
greater portion of the old province of Marche, together with
portions of Berry, Bourbonnais, Auvergne, Limousin and
Poitou. Area, 2164 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 274,094. It lies on the
north-western border of the central plateau and is bounded N.
by the departments of Indre and Cher, E. by Allier and Puy-de-Dôme,
S. by Corrèze and W. by Haute-Vienne. The surface is
hilly, with a general inclination north-westward in the direction
of the valley of the Creuse, sloping from the mountains of
Auvergne and Limousin, branches of which project into the
south of the department. The chief of these starts from the
Plateau de Gentioux, and under the name of the Mountains of
Marche extends along the left bank of the Creuse. The highest
point is in the forest of Châteauvert (3050 ft.) in the extreme
south-east of the department. Rivers, streams and lakes are
numerous, but none are navigable; the principal is the Creuse,
which rises on the north side of the mass of Mount Odouze on
the border of the department of Corrèze, and passes through
the department, dividing it into two nearly equal portions,
receiving the Petite Creuse from the right, and afterwards
flowing on to join the Vienne. The valleys of the head-streams
of the Cher and of its tributary the Tardes, which near Évaux
passes under a fine viaduct 300 ft. in height, occupy the eastern
side; those of the heads of the Vienne and its tributary the
Thaurion, and of the Gartempe joining the Creuse, are in the
west of the department. The climate is in general cold, moist
and variable; the rigorous winter covers the higher cantons
with snow; rain is abundant in spring, and storms are frequent
in summer, but the autumn is fine. Except in the valleys the
soil is poor and infertile, and agriculture is also handicapped by
the dearness of labour, due to the annual emigration of from
15,000 to 20,000 of the inhabitants to other parts of France,
where they serve as stonemasons, &amp;c. The produce of cereals,
chiefly rye, wheat, oats and buckwheat, is not sufficient for home
consumption. The chestnut abounds in the north and west;
hemp and potatoes are also grown. Cattle-rearing and sheep-breeding
are the chief industries of the department, which
supplies Poitou and Vendée with draught oxen. Coal is mined
to some extent, chiefly in the basin of Ahun. There are thermal
springs at Évaux in the east of the department, where remains
of Roman baths are preserved. The chief industrial establishments
are the manufactories of carpets and hangings and
the dyeworks of Aubusson and Felletin. Saw-mills and the
manufacture of wooden shoes and hats have some importance.
Exports include carpets, coal, live-stock and hats; imports
comprise raw materials for the manufactures and food-supplies.
The department is served by the Orléans railway company,
whose line from Montluçon to Périgueux traverses it from east
to west. It is divided into the four arrondissements of Guéret,
the capital Aubusson, Bourganeuf, and Boussac, and further
into 25 cantons and 266 communes. With Haute-Vienne,
Creuse forms the diocese of Limoges, where also is its court of
appeal. It forms part of the académie (educational division)
of Clermont and of the region of the XII. army corps. The
principal towns are Guéret and Aubusson. La Souterraine,
Chambon-sur-Voueize and Bénévent-l&rsquo;Abbaye possess fine
churches of the 12th century. At Moutier-d&rsquo;Ahun there is a
church, which has survived from a Benedictine abbey. The
nave of the 15th century with a fine portal, and the choir with
its carved stalls of the 17th century, are of considerable interest.
The small industrial town of Bourganeuf has remains of a priory,
including a tower (15th century) in which Zizim, brother of the
sultan Bajazet II., is said to have been imprisoned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREUTZ, GUSTAF FILIP,<a name="ar247" id="ar247"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1729-1785), Swedish poet,
was born in Finland in 1729. After concluding his studies in
Åbo he received a post in the court of chancery at Stockholm
in 1751. Here he met Count Gyllenborg, with whom his name
is indissolubly connected. They were closely allied with Fru
Nordenflycht, and their works were published in common;
to their own generation they seemed equal in fame, but posterity
has given the palm of genius to Creutz. His greatest work is
contained in the 1762 volume, the idyll of <i>Atis och Camilla</i>;
the exquisite little pastoral entitled &ldquo;Daphne&rdquo; was published
at the same time, and Gyllenborg was the first to proclaim the
supremacy of his friend. In 1763 Creutz practically closed his
poetical career; he went to Spain as ambassador, and after
three years to Paris in the same capacity. In 1783 Gustavus
III. recalled him and heaped honours upon him, but he died
soon after, on the 30th of October 1785. <i>Atis och Camilla</i>
was long the most admired poem in the Swedish language;
it is written in a spirit of pastoral which is now to some degree
faded, but in comparison with most of the other productions
of the time it is freshness itself. Creutz introduced a melody
and grace into the Swedish tongue which it lacked before, and
he has been styled &ldquo;the last artificer of the language.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CREUZER, GEORG FRIEDRICH<a name="ar248" id="ar248"></a></span> (1771-1858), German philologist
and archaeologist, was born on the 10th of March 1771,
at Marburg, the son of a bookbinder. Having studied at Marburg
and Jena, he for some time lived at Leipzig as a private tutor;
but in 1802 he was appointed professor at Marburg, and two
years later professor of philology and ancient history at Heidelberg.
The latter position he held for nearly forty-five years,
with the exception of a short time spent at the university of
Leiden, where his health was affected by the Dutch climate.
He was one of the principal founders of the Philological Seminary
established at Heidelberg in 1807. The Academy of Inscriptions
of Paris appointed him one of its members, and from the grand-duke
of Baden he received the dignity of privy councillor. He
died on the 16th of February 1858. Creuzer&rsquo;s first and most
famous work was his <i>Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
besonders der Griechen</i> (1810-1812), in which he maintained
that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod came from an Eastern
source through the Pelasgians, and was the remains of the symbolism
of an ancient revelation. This work was vigorously
attacked by Hermann in his <i>Briefen über Homer und Hesiod</i>,
and in his letter, addressed to Creuzer, <i>Über das Wesen und die
Behandlung der Mythologie</i>; by J. H. Voss in his <i>Antisymbolik</i>;
and by Lobek in his <i>Aglaophamos</i>. Of Creuzer&rsquo;s other works
the principal are an edition of Plotinus; a partial edition of
Cicero, in preparing which he was assisted by Moser; <i>Die
historische Kunst der Griechen</i> (1803); <i>Epochen der griech.
Literaturgeschichte</i> (1802); <i>Abriss der römischen Antiquitäten</i>

Moorish houses are enclosed by gardens of cactus, dwarf palm,
orange and other subtropical plants, interspersed with masses
of rock. The surrounding country, though naturally sterile, is
irrigated from two adjacent springs, which differ in temperature
by no less than 25° F. The district is famous for its melons,

of Durham, was a son of John Crew (1598-1679), who was created
Baron Crew of Stene in 1661, and a grandson of Sir Thomas Crew
(1565-1634), speaker of the House of Commons. Born on the
31st of January 1633, Nathaniel was educated at Lincoln College,
Oxford, and was appointed rector of the college in 1668. He
became dean and precentor of Chichester in 1669, clerk of the
closet to Charles II. shortly afterwards, bishop of Oxford in
1671, and bishop of Durham in 1674. He owed his rapid preferment
to James, then duke of York, whose favour he had gained
by conniving at the duke&rsquo;s leanings to the Roman Church. After
the accession of James II. Crew received the deanery of the Chapel
Royal. He served in 1686 on the revived ecclesiastical commission
which suspended Compton, bishop of London, and then
shared the administration of the see of London with Sprat,
bishop of Rochester. In 1687 he was a member of another
ecclesiastical commission, which suspended the vice-chancellor
of the university of Cambridge for refusing the degree of M.A.
to a monk who would not take the customary oath. On the decline
of James&rsquo;s power Crew dissociated himself from the court,
and made a bid for the favour of the new government by voting
for the motion that James had abdicated. He was excepted
from the general pardon of 1690, but afterwards was allowed to
retain his see. He left large estates to be devoted to charitable
ends, and his benefaction to Lincoln College and to Oxford
University is commemorated in the annual Crewian oration.
In 1697 Crew succeeded his brother Thomas as 3rd Baron Crew,
He died on the 18th of September 1721, when the barony became
extinct.</p>

In 1880 he married Sibyl Marcia Graham, who died in 1887,
leaving him with two daughters. He inherited his father&rsquo;s
literary tastes, and published <i>Stray Verses</i> in 1890, besides other
miscellaneous literary work. A Liberal in politics, he became
private secretary to Lord Granville when secretary of state for
foreign affairs (1883-1884), and in 1886 was made a lord-in-waiting.
In the Liberal administration of 1892-1895 he was

secretary. In 1895 he was created 1st earl of Crewe, his maternal
grandfather, the 2nd Baron Crewe, having left him his heir.
In 1899 he married Lady Margaret Primrose, daughter of the

<p><span class="bold">CREWE,<a name="ar255" id="ar255"></a></span> a municipal borough in the Crewe parliamentary
division of Cheshire, England, 158 m. N.W. of London, on the
main line of the London &amp; North-Western railway. Pop. (1901)
42,074. The town was built on an estate called Oak Farm in
the parish of Monk&rsquo;s Coppenhall, and takes its name from the
original stations having been placed in the township of Crewe, in
which the seat of Lord Crewe is situated. It is a railway junction
where lines converge from London, Manchester, North Wales
and Holyhead, North Stafford and Hereford. It is inhabited
principally by persons in the employment of the London &amp;
North-Western railway company, and was practically created
by that corporation, at a point where in 1841 only a farmhouse
stood in open country. Crewe is not only one of the busiest
railway stations in the world, but is the locomotive metropolis of
the London &amp; North-Western company, which has centred here
enormous workshops for the manufacture of the material and
plant used in railways. In 1901 the 4000th locomotive was turned
out of the works. A series of subterranean ways extending many
miles have been constructed to enable merchandise traffic to pass
through without interfering with passenger trains on the surface
railways. The company possesses one of the finest electric
stations in the world, and electrical apparatus for the working of
train signals is in operation. The station is fitted with an
extensive suite of offices for the interchange of postal traffic,
the chief mails to and from Ireland and Scotland being stopped
here and arranged for various distributing centres. Its enormous
railway facilities and its geographical situation as the junction
of the great trunk lines running north and south, tapping also
the Staffordshire potteries on the one side and the great mineral
districts of Wales on the other, constitute Crewe station one of
the most important links of railway and postal communication
in the kingdom. The railway company built its principal schools,
provided it with a mechanics&rsquo; institute, containing library,
science and art classes, reading rooms, assembly rooms, &amp;c.
Victoria Park, also the gift of the company, was opened in 1888.
The municipal corporation built the technical school and school
of art. The borough incorporated in 1877, is under a mayor,
7 aldermen and 21 councillors. Area, 2185 acres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRIB<a name="ar257" id="ar257"></a></span> (a word common to some Teutonic languages, cf.
Dutch <i>krib</i> and Ger. <i>Krippe</i>; it has a common origin with
the O. Eng. &ldquo;cratch,&rdquo; a manger or crib, cf. Fr. <i>crêche</i>),
a manger or framework receptacle for holding fodder for cattle
and horses, and so, from early times in English, particularly the
manger in which Jesus was laid. It is thus used of a &ldquo;cradle,&rdquo;
from which in form it should be distinguished as being a small
bed with high closed-in sides. The word has many transferred
meanings, as a rough, small hut or dwelling, from which comes
the slang use of &ldquo;crib&rdquo; as a berth or situation, or, as a burglar&rsquo;s
term for a house to be broken into; also, technically, in engineering
for a timber framework for masonry constructed with a
caisson in laying foundations below water, or in mining for a
timber lining to a shaft. &ldquo;Crib-biting&rdquo; is a vicious habit in
horses, probably due in the first instance to indigestion; the
horse seizes the manger or other object in its teeth, and draws
in the breath, known as &ldquo;wind-sucking&rdquo;; the habit may be
checked by the use of a throat-strap. The slang meaning of the
verb &ldquo;crib,&rdquo; to steal, especially used of petty thefts, is probably
derived from an obsolete use of the substantive for a small
wicker basket; this meaning occurs in the expression &ldquo;time-cribbing,&rdquo;
used of an illicit increase of the hours of labour in
a factory or workshop, especially by the running of machinery
each day slightly beyond the time of ceasing work. &ldquo;Crib&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cribbing&rdquo; in this sense are also applied to any unacknowledged
appropriation or plagiarism from an author, and particularly
to the secret copying by a schoolboy of another&rsquo;s work or
from a book, and also to the secret use of a translation and to
such translation itself. &ldquo;Crib,&rdquo; in the game of cribbage, of
which it is a shortened form, is the term for the cards thrown
away by each player and scored by the dealer.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIBBAGE,<a name="ar258" id="ar258"></a></span> a game of cards. A very similar game called
&ldquo;Noddy&rdquo; was formerly played, the game being fifteen or twenty-one
up, marked with counters, occasionally by means of a noddy
board. Cribbage seems to be an improved form of Noddy.
According to John Aubrey (<i>Brief Lives</i>) it was invented by Sir
John Suckling (1609-1642).</p>

<p>A complete pack of fifty-two cards is required, and a cribbage
board for scoring, drilled with sixty holes for each player and
one hole (called &ldquo;the game hole&rdquo;) at each end, the players usually
scoring from opposite ends. Each player has two scoring pegs.
The game is marked by inserting the pegs in the holes, one after
the other, as the player makes a fresh score, commencing with the
outer row at the game-hole end and going up the board. When
the thirtieth hole is reached the player comes down the board,
using the inner row of holes, until he places his foremost peg in the
game-hole. If the losing player fails to obtain half the holes,
his adversary wins a &ldquo;lurch,&rdquo; or double game.</p>

<p>The game may be played by two players, five or six cards
being dealt to each, and each putting out two for what is called
&ldquo;crib&rdquo;; or by three players (with a triangular scoring board),
five cards being dealt to each, each putting out one for crib,
and a card from the top of the pack being dealt to complete the
crib; or by four players (two being partners against the other
two, sitting and playing as at whist, and one partner scoring for
both), five cards being dealt to each, and each putting out one card
for crib.</p>

<p>Two-handed five-card cribbage was formerly considered the
most scientific game, but this verdict has now been reversed in
favour of the six-card game. In six-card cribbage both hands
and crib contain four cards, and 121 holes are scored.</p>

<p>The players cut for deal, the lowest dealing. If more than one
game is played, the winner of the last game deals. The cards
rank from king (highest) to the ace (lowest). At the two-handed
five-card game, the non-dealer scores three holes (called &ldquo;three
for last&rdquo;) at any time during the game, but usually while the
dealer is dealing the first hand. This is not part of the six-card
game, which we take as our example.</p>

<p>The dealer deals six cards to each, singly. The undealt cards
are placed face downwards on the table. The players then
look at their hands and &ldquo;lay out,&rdquo; each putting two cards face
downwards on the table, on the side of the board nearest to the
dealer, for the &ldquo;crib.&rdquo; A player must not take back into his hand
a card he has laid out if the cards have been covered, nor must
the crib be touched during the play of his hand.</p>

<p>After laying out, the non-dealer (when more than two play,
the player to the dealer&rsquo;s left) cuts the pack, and the dealer turns
up the top card of the lower packet, called the &ldquo;start,&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn-up.&rdquo;
If this is a knave, the dealer marks two &ldquo;for his heels.&rdquo;
This score is forfeited if not marked before the dealer plays a
card.</p>

<p>The non-dealer plays first by laying face upwards on the table
on his side of the board any card from his hand; the dealer then
does the same, and so on alternately. When more than two play,
the player to the leader&rsquo;s left plays the second card, and so on.
As soon as the first card is laid down the player calls out the
number of pips on it; if a picture card, ten. When the second
card is laid down, the player calls out the sum of the pips on the
two cards played, and so on until all the cards are played, or
until neither player can play without passing the number thirty-one.
If one player has a card or cards that will come in and the
other has not, he is at liberty to play them; at the six-card game
he must play as long as they can come in, and he can score
runs or make pairs, &amp;c., with them. If one player&rsquo;s cards are
exhausted, the adversary plays out his own, and can score with
them. When more than two play, the player next in rotation
is bound to play, and so on until no one can come in. At the two-handed
five-card game, when neither can come in the play stops;
at the other games the cards are played turned down, and the
remainder of the cards are played in rotation, and so on until
all are played out.</p>

<p>The object of the play is to make <i>pairs</i>, <i>fifteens</i>,
<i>sequences</i>,
and the &ldquo;go,&rdquo; and to prevent the adversary from scoring.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Pairs.</i>&mdash;If a card is put down of the same denomination as the one
last played, the player pairing scores two holes. If a third card of
the same denomination is next played, a &ldquo;pair royal&rdquo; (abbreviated
to &ldquo;prial&rdquo;) is made, and the maker scores six holes. If a fourth
card of the same denomination is next played, twelve holes are scored
for the &ldquo;double pair royal.&rdquo; Kings pair only with kings, queens
with queens, and so with knaves and tens, notwithstanding that they
all count ten in play.</p>

<p><i>Fifteens.</i>&mdash;If either player during the play reaches fifteen exactly,
by reckoning the values of all the played cards, he marks two.</p>

<p><i>Sequences.</i>&mdash;If during the play of the hand three or more cards are
consecutively played which make an ascending or descending
sequence, the maker of the sequence marks one hole for each card
forming the sequence or run. King, queen, knave and ten reckon
in sequence in this order, notwithstanding that they are all tenth
cards in play; the other cards according to the number of their
pips. The ace is not in sequence with king, queen. If one player
obtains a run of three, his adversary can put down a card in sequence
and mark four, and so on. And, if there is a break in the sequence,
and the break is filled up during the play, without the intervention
of a card not in sequence, the player of the card that fills the break
scores a run. Thus the cards are played in this order: A-4, B-3,
A-2, B-ace, A gets a run of three, B a run of four. Had B&rsquo;s last
card been a five, he would similarly have scored a run of four, as
there is no break. Had B&rsquo;s last card been a four, he would have
scored a run of three. The cards need not be played in order. Thus
the cards being played in this order, A-4, B-2, A-5, B-3, A-6, A-4,
B-2, A-5, B-3, A-5, B-6, B takes a run of four for the fourth card
played, but there is no run for any one else, as the second five intervenes.
Again, if the cards at six-card cribbage are thus played, A-4,
B-2, A-3, B-ace, A-5, B-2, A-4, B-ace, A takes a run of three, B a
run of four, A a run of five. B then playing the deuce has no run,
as the deuce previously played intervenes.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;go,&rdquo; end hole or last card is scored by the player who
approaches most nearly to thirty-one during the play, and entitles
to a score of one. If thirty-one is reached exactly, it is a go of two
instead of one. After a go no card already played can be counted
for pairs or sequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span></p>

<p><i>Compound Scores.</i>&mdash;More than one of the above scores can be made
at the same time. Thus a player pairing with the last card that will
come in scores both pair and go. Similarly a pair and a fifteen, or a
sequence and a fifteen, can be reckoned together.</p>

<p>When the play is over, the hands are shown and counted aloud.
The non-dealer has first show and scores and marks first; the dealer
afterwards counts, scores and marks what he has in hand, and then
takes what is in crib. In counting both hands and crib the &ldquo;start&rdquo;
is included, so that five cards are involved.</p>

<p>The combinations in hand or crib which entitle to a score are
fifteen, pairs or pairs royal, sequences, flushes and &ldquo;his nob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Fifteens.</i>&mdash;All the combinations of cards that, taken together,
make fifteen exactly, count two. For example, a ten (King, Queen,
Knave or Ten) card and a five reckon two, called as &ldquo;fifteen two.&rdquo;
Another five in the hand or turned up would again combine with the
ten card, and entitle to another fifteen (&ldquo;fifteen four&rdquo;); if the other
cards were a two and a three, two other fifteens would be counted
(&ldquo;fifteen six,&rdquo; &ldquo;fifteen eight&rdquo;)&mdash;one for the combination of the
three and two with the ten card, and one for the combination of the
two fives with the three and two. Similarly two ten cards and two
fives reckon eight; a nine and three threes count six; and so on for
other cards.</p>

<p><i>Pairs.</i>&mdash;Pairs are reckoned as in play.</p>

<p><i>Sequences.</i>&mdash;Three or more cards in sequence count one for each
card. If one sequence card can be substituted for another of the
same denomination, the sequence reckons again. For example, 3,4,5
and a 3 turned up reckon two sequences of three; with another 3
there would be three sequences of three, and so on.</p>

<p><i>Flushes.</i>&mdash;If all the cards in hand are of the same suit, one is
reckoned for each card. If the start is also of the same suit, one
is reckoned for that also. In crib, no flush is reckoned unless the
start is of the same suit as the cards in crib.</p>

<p><i>His Nob.</i>&mdash;If a player holds the knave of the suit turned up for the
start he counts one &ldquo;for his nob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dialogue will illustrate the technical conversation of the game,
in a game at six-card cribbage. The cards for crib having been discarded,
A holds knave of hearts, a four and a pair of twos: B holds
a pair of nines, a six and a four. Two of hearts is turned up by B.
The hand might be played thus. A lays down a two and says
&ldquo;Two&rdquo;: B plays a nine and says &ldquo;Eleven&rdquo;: A follows with a
four, saying &ldquo;Fifteen two&rdquo;; pegging two holes at once: B plays
his four and says &ldquo;Nineteen; two for a pair,&rdquo; and pegs: A putting
on his knave, &ldquo;Twenty-nine&rdquo;; B says &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; A lays down his
two, his last card, and says &ldquo;Thirty-one; good for two.&rdquo; B plays
his nine and six, saying &ldquo;Fifteen two, and one for my last&mdash;three.&rdquo;
The points are marked as they are made. A then counts his hand
aloud. &ldquo;Six for a pair-royal&rdquo; or &ldquo;Three twos&mdash;good for six,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;One for his nob&mdash;seven,&rdquo; and throws down his hand for B&rsquo;s
inspection. B, &ldquo;Fifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, fifteen eight,
and a pair are ten.&rdquo; B then looks at his crib and counts it. It
contains, say, king, eight, three, ace and the &ldquo;start&rdquo; is also reckoned.
B counts &ldquo;Fifteen two and a run of three&mdash;five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the points in hand and crib are reckoned, the cards are
shuffled and dealt again, and so on alternately until the game is won.</p>

<p>The highest possible score in hand is 29&mdash;three fives and a knave,
with a five, of the same suit as the knave, turned up.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRICCIETH,<a name="ar259" id="ar259"></a></span> a watering-place and contributory parliamentary
borough of Carnarvonshire, Wales, on Cardigan Bay, served by
the Cambrian railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 1406. It is
interesting for its high antiquity and the ruined castle, a fortress
on an eminence where a neck of land ends, projecting into the sea.
Portions of two towers are on the very verge of the rock. A double
fosse and vallum, with the outer and inner court lines, can
be traced. Apparently British, the castle was repaired later,
probably in the time of Edward I. Across the bay is seen
Harlech castle, backed by the Merionethshire hills. An old
county-family mansion near Criccieth is Gwynfryn (happy hill),
the seat of the Nanneys, situated near the stream Dwyfawr and
within some 7 m. of Pwllheli. Not far is a tumulus, <i>Tomen
fawr</i>. At a distance of 5 m. is Tremadoc (which owes its name.
Town of Madocks&mdash;as does Portmadoc&mdash;to Mr W. Madocks,
of Morfa Lodge, who made the embankment here). Criccieth
has become a favourite watering-place, as well as a centre of
excursions. The neighbourhood is agreeable, and the Cardigan
Bay shore is shelving and suitable for safe bathing. Cantref y
Gwaelod (the hundred of the bottom) is the Welsh literary
name of this bay, on the shores of which geological depression
has certainly taken place. Mythical history relates how
Seithennin&rsquo;s drunkenness inundated the land now covered by the
bay, and how King Arthur&rsquo;s ship was wrecked upon Meisdiroedd
Enlli near Bardsey. The <i>Mabinogion</i> tell how Harlech was a
port. Similarly, in Carnarvon Bay, about 2 m. seaward, at
low water, are visible the ruins of Caerarianrhod (fortified town
of the silver wheel), a submerged town&mdash;due to another geological
depression.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRICHTON, JAMES<a name="ar260" id="ar260"></a></span> (1560-? 1582), commonly called the
&ldquo;Admirable Crichton,&rdquo; was the son of Robert Crichton, lord
advocate of Scotland in the reign of Mary and James VI., and of
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Stewart of Beath, through
whom he claimed royal descent. He was born probably at
Eliock in Dumfriesshire in 1560, and when ten years old was sent
to St Salvator&rsquo;s College, St Andrews, where he took his B.A. in
1574 and his M.A. in 1575. In 1577 Crichton was undoubtedly in
Paris, but his career on the continent is difficult to follow. That
he displayed considerable classical knowledge, was a good
linguist, a ready and versatile writer of verse, and above all that
he possessed an astounding memory, seems certain, not only
from the evidence of men of his own time, but from the fact that
even Joseph Scaliger (<i>Prima Scaligerana</i>, p. 58, 1669) speaks of
his attainments with the highest praise. But those works of his
which have come down to us show few traces of unusual ability;
and the laudation of him as a universal genius by Sir Thomas
Urquhart and Aldus Manutius requires to be discounted.
Urquhart (in his <i>Discovery of a most exquisite jewel</i>) states that
while in Paris Crichton successfully held a dispute in the college of
Navarre, on any subject and in twelve languages, and that the
next day he won a tilting match at the Louvre. There is, however,
no contemporary evidence for this, the only certain facts
being that for two years Crichton served in the French army, and
that in 1579 he arrived in Genoa. The latter event is proved by a
Latin address (of no particular merit) to the Doge and Senate
entitled <i>Oratio J. Critonii Scoti pro Moderatorum Genuensis
Reipubl. electione coram Senatu habita....</i> (Genoa, 1579). The
next year Crichton was in Venice, and won the friendship of Aldus
Manutius by his Latin ode <i>In appulsu ad urbem Venetam de
Proprio statu J. Critonii Scoti Carmen ad Aldum Manuccium....</i>
(Venice, 1580). The best contemporary evidence for Crichton&rsquo;s
stay in Venice is a handbill printed by the Guerra press in 1580
(and now in the British Museum), giving a short biography and an
extravagant eulogy of his powers; he speaks ten languages, has a
command of philosophy, theology, mathematics; he improvises
Latin verses in all metres and on all subjects, has all Aristotle
and his commentators at his fingers&rsquo; ends; is of most beautiful
appearance, a soldier from top to toe, &amp;c. This work is undoubtedly
by Manutius, as it was reprinted with his name in
1581 as <i>Relatione della qualità di ... Crettone</i>, and again in
1582 (reprinted Venice, 1831).</p>

<p>In Venice Crichton met and vanquished all disputants except
Giacomo Mazzoni, was followed from place to place by crowds of
admirers, and won the affection of the humanists Lorenzo Massa
and Giovanni Donati. In March 1581 he went to Padua, where
he held two great disputations. In the first he extemporized
in succession a Latin poem, a daring onslaught on Aristotelian
ignorance, and an oration in praise of ignorance. In the second,
which took place in the Church of St John and St Paul, and lasted
three days, he undertook to refute innumerable errors in Aristotelians,
mathematicians and schoolmen, to conduct his dispute
either logically or by the secret doctrine of numbers, &amp;c. According
to Aldus, who attended the debate and published an account of
it in his dedication to Crichton prefixed to Cicero&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradoxa&rdquo;
(1581), the young Scotsman was completely successful. In June
Crichton was once more in Venice, and while there wrote two
Latin odes to his friends Lorenzo Massa and Giovanni Donati, but
after this date the details of his life are obscure. Urquhart
states that he went to Mantua, became the tutor of the young
prince of Mantua, Vincenzo di Gonzaga, and was killed by the
latter in a street quarrel in 1582. Aldus in his edition of Cicero&rsquo;s
<i>De universitate</i> (1583), dedicated to Crichton, laments the 3rd
of July as the fatal day; and this account is apparently confirmed
by the Mantuan state papers recently unearthed by Mr
Douglas Crichton (<i>Proc. Soc. of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, 1909).
Mr Sidney Lee (<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>) argued against this date, on the
ground that in 1584 and 1585 Crichton was alive and in Milan,
as certain works of his published in that year testified, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
regarded it as probable that he died in Mantua c. 1585/6. But
these later works seem to have been by another man of the same
name. The epithet &ldquo;admirable&rdquo; (<i>admirabilis</i>) for Crichton
first occurs in John Johnston&rsquo;s <i>Heroes Scoti</i> (1603). It is probably
impossible to recover the whole truth either as to Crichton&rsquo;s
death or as to the extent of his attainments, which were so
quickly elevated into legendary magnitude.</p>

excellent jewel</i> (1652; reprinted in the Maitland Club&rsquo;s edition of
Urquhart&rsquo;s Works in 1834) is written with the express purpose of
glorifying Scotland. The panegyrics of Aldus Manutius require to
be received with some caution, since he was given to exaggerating
the merits of his friend, and uses almost the same language about a
young Pole named Stanilaus Niegosevski; see John Black&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Torquato Tasso</i>, ii. 413-451 (1810), for a criticism. The <i>Life of

<p><span class="bold">CRICKET<a name="ar261" id="ar261"></a></span> (<i>Gryllidae</i>), a family of saltatory Orthopterous
Insects, closely related to the Locustidae. The wings when
folded form long slender filaments, which often reach beyond the
extremity of the body, and give the appearance of a bifid tail,
while in the male they are provided with a stridulating apparatus
by which the well-known chirping sound, to which the insect
owes its name, is produced. The abdomen of the female ends in a
long slender ovipositor, which, however, is not exserted in the
mole cricket. The house cricket (<i>Gryllus domesticus</i>) is of a
greyish-yellow colour marked with brown. It frequents houses,
especially in rural districts, where its lively, if somewhat
monotonous, chirp may be heard nightly in the neighbourhood of
the fireplace. It is particularly fond of warmth, and is thus
frequently found in bakeries, where its burrows are often sunk to
within a few inches of the oven. In the hot summer it goes out of
doors, and frequents the walls of gardens, but returns again to its
place by the hearth on the first approach of cold, where, should
the heat of the fire be withdrawn, it becomes dormant. It is
nocturnal, coming forth at the evening twilight in search of food,
which consists of bread crumbs and other refuse of the kitchen.
The field cricket (<i>Gryllus campestris</i>) is a larger insect than the
former, and of a darker colour. It burrows in the ground to a
depth of from 6 to 12 in., and in the evening the male may be
observed sitting at the mouth of its hole noisily stridulating until
a female approaches, &ldquo;when,&rdquo; says Bates, &ldquo;the louder notes are
succeeded by a more subdued tone, whilst the successful musician
caresses with his antennae the mate he has won.&rdquo; The musical
apparatus in this species consists of upwards of 130 transverse
ridges on the under side of one of the nervures of the wing cover,
which are rapidly scraped over a smooth, projecting nervure on
the opposite wing. The female deposits her eggs&mdash;about 200 in
number&mdash;on the ground, and when hatched the larvae, which
resemble the perfect insect except in the absence of wings, form
burrows for themselves in which they pass the winter. The
mole cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>) owes its name to the striking
analogy in its habits and structure to those of the common
mole. Its body is thick and cylindrical in shape, and it burrows
by means of its front legs, which are short and greatly flattened
out and thickened, with the outer edge partly notched so as
somewhat to resemble a hand. It prefers loose and sandy
ground in which to dig, its burrow consisting of a vertical shaft
from which long horizontal galleries are given off; and in making
those excavations it does immense injury to gardens and vineyards
by destroying the tender roots of plants, which form its principal
food. It also feeds upon other insects, and even upon the weak
of its own species in the absence of other food. It is exceedingly
fierce and voracious, and is usually caught by inserting a stem of
grass into its hole, which being seized, is retained till the insect is
brought to the surface. The female deposits her eggs in a neatly
constructed subterranean chamber, about the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg,
and sufficiently near the surface to allow of the eggs being hatched
by the heat of the sun.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRICKET.<a name="ar262" id="ar262"></a></span> The game of cricket may be called the national
summer pastime of the English race. The etymology of the word
itself is the subject of much dispute. The <i>Century Dictionary</i>
connects with O. Fr. <i>criquet</i>, &ldquo;a stick used as a mark in the game of
bowls,&rdquo; and denies the connexion with A.S. <i>crice</i> or <i>cryce</i>, a staff.
A claim has also been made for <i>cricket</i>, meaning a stool, from the
stool at which the ball was bowled, while in the wardrobe account
of King Edward I. for the year 1300 (p. 126) is found an allusion
to a game called <i>creag</i>. Skeat, in his <i>Etymological Dictionary</i>,
states that the word is probably derived from A.S. <i>crice</i> (repudiated
by the first authority quoted), the meaning of which is a
staff, and suggests that the &ldquo;et&rdquo; is a diminutive suffix; the word
is of the same origin as &ldquo;crutch.&rdquo; Finally the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> traces the O. Fr. <i>criquet</i>, defined by Littré as &ldquo;<i>jeu
d&rsquo;addresse</i>,&rdquo; to M. Flem. <i>Krick, Krüke, baston à s&rsquo;appuyer,
quinette, potence</i>.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;In a MS. of the middle of the 13th century, in the
King&rsquo;s library, 14 Bv, entitled <i>Chronique d&rsquo;Angleterre, depuis
Ethelberd jusqu&rsquo;à Hen. III.</i>, there is found a grotesque delineation
of two male figures playing a game with a bat and ball. This is
undoubtedly the first known drawing of what was destined to
develop into the scientific cricket of modern times. The left-hand
figure is that of the batsman, who holds his weapon upright
in the right hand with the handle downwards. The right-hand
figure shows the catcher, whose duty is at once apparent by the
extension of his hands. In another portion of the same MS.,
however, there is a male figure pointing a bat towards a female
figure in the attitude of catching, but the ball is absent. In a
Bodleian Library MS., No. 264, dated the 18th of April 1344, and
entitled <i>Romance of the Good King Alexander</i>, fielders for the
first time appear in addition to the batsman and bowler. All the
players are monks (not female figures, as Strutt misinterprets
their dress in his <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>), and on the extreme left
of the picture, the bowler, with his cowl up, poises the ball in the
right hand with the arm nearly horizontal. The batsman comes
next with his cowl down, a little way only to the right, standing
sideways to the bowler with a long roughly-hewn and slightly-curved
bat, held upright, handle downwards in the left hand.
On the extreme right come four figures&mdash;with cowls alternately
down and up, and all having their hands raised in an attitude to
catch the ball. It has been argued that the bat was always
held in the left hand at this date, since on the opposite page of
the same MS. a solitary monk is figured with his cowl down, and
also holding a somewhat elongated oval-shaped implement in
his left hand; but it is unsafe to assume that the accuracy of
the artist can be trusted.</p>

<p>The close roll of 39 Edw. III. (1365), Men. 23, disparages
certain games on account of their interfering with the practice of
archery, where the game of cricket is probably included among the
pastimes denounced as &ldquo;ludos inhonestos, et minus utiles aut
valentes.&rdquo; In this instance cricket was clearly considered fit for
the lower orders only, though it is evident from the entry in
King Edward&rsquo;s wardrobe account, already mentioned, that in
1300 the game of <i>creag</i> was patronized by the nobility. Judging
from the drawings, it can only be conjectured that the game
consisted of bowling, batting and fielding, though it is known
that there was an in-side and an out-side, for sometime during the
15th century the game was called &ldquo;Hondyn or Hondoute,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Hand in and Hand out.&rdquo; Under this title it was interdicted
by 17 Edw. IV. c. 3 (1477-1478), as one of those illegal games
which still continued to be so detrimental to the practice of
archery. By this statute, any one allowing the game to be played
on his premises was liable to three years&rsquo; imprisonment and £20
fine, any player to two years&rsquo; imprisonment and £10 fine, and
the implements to be burnt. The inference that hand in and
hand out was analogous to cricket is made from a passage in the
Hon. Daines Barrington&rsquo;s <i>Observations on the more Ancient Statutes
from Magna Charta to 21 James I. cap. 27</i>. Writing in 1766, he
comments thus on the above statute, viz.: &ldquo;This is, perhaps,
the most severe law ever made against gaming, and some
of these forbidden sports seem to have been manly exercises,
particularly the <i>handyn</i> and <i>handoute</i>, which I should suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
to be a kind of cricket, as the term hands is still retained in
that game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;cricket&rdquo; occurs about the year 1550. In Russell&rsquo;s
<i>History of Guildford</i> it appears there was a piece of waste land in
the parish of Holy Trinity in that city, which was enclosed by
one John Parish, an innholder, some five years before Queen
Elizabeth came to the throne. In 35 Elizabeth (1593) evidence
was taken before a jury and a verdict returned, ordering the
garden to be laid waste again and disinclosed. Amongst other
witnesses John Derrick, gent., and one of H.M.&rsquo;s coroners for
Surrey, <i>aetat.</i> fifty-nine, deposed he had known the ground for
fifty years or more, and &ldquo;when he was a scholler in the free
school of Guildford, he and several of his fellowes did runne
and play there at <i>crickett</i> and other plaies.&rdquo; In the original
edition of Stow&rsquo;s <i>Survey of London</i> (1598) the word does not
occur, though he says, &ldquo;The ball is used by noblemen and
gentlemen in tennis courts, and by people of the meaner sort in
the open fields and streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some noteworthy references to the game may be cited. In
Giovanni Florio&rsquo;s dictionary <i>A Worlde of Wordes most Copious
and Exact</i>, published in Italy in 1595 and in London three years
later, <i>squillare</i> is defined as &ldquo;to make a noise as a cricket, to
play cricket-a-wicket and be merry.&rdquo; Sir William Dugdale
states that in his youth Oliver Cromwell, who was born in 1599,
threw &ldquo;himself into a dissolute and disorderly course,&rdquo; became
&ldquo;famous for football, cricket, cudgelling and wrestling,&rdquo; and
acquired &ldquo;the name of royster.&rdquo; In Randle Cotgrave&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary
of French and English</i>, dated 1611, <i>Crosse</i> is translated
&ldquo;crosier or bishop&rsquo;s staffe wherewith boys play at cricket,&rdquo; and
<i>Crosser</i> &ldquo;to play at cricket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the earliest traces of cricket at public schools is an
allusion to be found in the <i>Life of Bishop Ken</i> by William Lisle
Bowles (1830). Concerning the subject of this biography, who
was admitted to Winchester on the 13th of January 1650/1,
it is said &ldquo;on the fifth or sixth day, our junior ... is found
for the first time attempting to wield a cricket bat.&rdquo; In 1688 a
&ldquo;ram and bat&rdquo; is charged in an Etonian&rsquo;s school bill, but it is
possible this may only refer to a cudgel used for ram-baiting.
In <i>The Life of Thomas Wilson, Minister of Maidstone</i>, published
anonymously in 1672, Wilson having been born in 1601 and
dying in or about 1653, occurs the following passage (p. 40):
&ldquo;Maidstone was formerly a very profane town, in as much as I
have seen morrice-dancing, cudgel-playing, stool-ball, crickets,
and many other sports openly and publicly indulged in on the
Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; Cricket is found enumerated as one of the games
of Gargantua in <i>The Works of Rabelais</i>, translated in 1653 by
Sir Thomas Urchard (Urquhart), vol. i. ch. xxii. p. 97. In a
poem entitled <i>The Mysteries of Love and Eloquence or the Arts of
Wooing and Complimenting</i> (1658), by Edward Phillips, John
Milton&rsquo;s nephew, the mistress of a country bumpkin when she
goes to a fair with him says &ldquo;Would my eyes had been beaten out
of my head with a cricket ball.&rdquo; The St Alban&rsquo;s Cricket Club
was founded in 1661, one of its earliest presidents being James
Cecil, 4th earl of Salisbury (1666-1694).</p>

<p>In 1662 John Davies of Kidwelly issued his translation of
Adam Olearius&rsquo; work entitled <i>The Voyages and Travels of the
Ambassadors from the Duke of Holstein to the Grand Duke of
Muscovy, and the King of Persia. Begun in the year 1633 and
finished in 1639</i>. On page 297 is a description of the exercises
indulged in by the Persian grandees in 1637, and the statement
is made that &ldquo;They play there also at a certain game,
which the Persians call <i>Kuitskaukan</i>, which is a kind of <i>Mall</i>,
or <i>Cricket</i>.&rdquo; In the Clerkenwell parish book of 1668 the
proprietor of the Rum Inn, Smithfield, is found rated for a
cricket field.</p>

<p>The chaplain of H.M.S., &ldquo;Assistance,&rdquo; Rev. Henry Teonge,
states in his diary that during a visit to Antioch on the 6th of
May 1676, several of the ship&rsquo;s company, accompanied by the
consul, rode out of the city early and amongst other pastimes
indulged in &ldquo;krickett.&rdquo; During the first half of the 18th century
the popularity of the game increased and is frequently mentioned
by writers of the time, such as Swift, who alludes sneeringly to
&ldquo;footmen at cricket,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Urfey, Pope, Soame Jenyns, Strype
in his edition of Stow&rsquo;s <i>Survey of London</i>, and Arbuthnot in
<i>John Bull</i>, iv. 4, &ldquo;when he happened to meet with a football or
a match at cricket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1748 it was decided that cricket was not an illegal game
under the statute 9 Anne, cap. 19, the court of king&rsquo;s bench
holding &ldquo;that it was a very manly game, not bad in itself,
but only in the ill use made of it by betting more than ten
pounds on it; but that was bad and against the law.&rdquo; Frederick
Louis, prince of Wales, died in 1751 from internal injuries caused
by a blow from a cricket ball whilst playing at Cliefden House.
Games at this period were being played for large stakes, ground
proprietors and tavern-keepers farming and advertising matches,
the results of which were not always above suspicion. The old
Artillery Ground at Finsbury was one of the earliest sites of this
type of fixture. Here it was that the London Club&mdash;formed
about 1700&mdash;played its matches. The president was the prince
of Wales, and many noblemen were among its supporters. It
flourished for more than half a century. One of the very earliest
full-scores kept in the modern fashion is that of the match
between Kent and All England, played on the Artillery Ground
on the 18th of June 1744.</p>

<p>Cricket, however, underwent its most material development
in the southern counties, more especially in the hop-growing
districts. It was at the large hop-fairs, notably that of Weyhill,
to which people from all the neighbouring shires congregated,
that county matches were principally arranged.</p>

<p>The famous Hambledon Club lasted approximately from 1750
to 1791. Its matches were played on Broad Half-Penny and
Windmill Downs, and in its zenith the club frequently contended
with success against All England. The chief players were more
or less retainers of the noblemen and other wealthy patrons of
cricket. The original society was broken up in 1791 owing to
Richard Nyren, their &ldquo;general,&rdquo; abandoning the game, of which
in consequence &ldquo;the head and right arm were gone.&rdquo; The
dispersion of the players over the neighbouring counties caused
a diffusion of the best spirit of the game, which gradually extended
northward and westward until, at the close of the 18th
century, cricket became established as the national game, and
the custom became general to play the first game of each year on
Good Friday.</p>

<p>The M.C.C. (or Marylebone Cricket Club), which ranks as
the leading club devoted to the game in any part of the globe,
sprang from the old Artillery Ground Club, which played at
Finsbury until about 1780, when the members migrating to
White Conduit Fields became the White Conduit Cricket Club.
In 1787 they were remodelled under their present title, and
moved to Lord&rsquo;s ground, then on the site of what is now Dorset
Square; thence in 1811 to Lord&rsquo;s second ground nearer what
is now the Regent&rsquo;s Canal; and in 1814, when the canal was cut,
to what is now Lord&rsquo;s ground in St John&rsquo;s Wood. Thomas
Lord, whose family were obliged to leave their native Scotland
on account of their participation in the rebellion of 1745, was
born in Thirsk, Yorkshire, in 1757, and is first heard of as an
attendant at the White Conduit Club, London, in 1780. Soon
afterwards he selected and superintended a cricket ground for
the earl of Winchilsea and other gentlemen, which was called
after his name. He died in 1832 on a farm at West Meon,
Hampshire, of which he took the management two years before.
Lord took away the original turf of his cricket-ground at each
migration and relaid it. In 1825 the pavilion was burnt down,
invaluable early records of the game being destroyed; and in
the same year the ground would have been broken up into
building plots had not William Ward purchased Lord&rsquo;s interest.
Dark bought him out in 1836, selling the remainder of his lease
to the club in 1864. Meanwhile, in 1860, the freehold had been
purchased at public auction by a Mr Marsden&mdash;<i>né</i> Moses&mdash;for
£7000, and he sold it to the club six years later for nearly £18,500,
a similar sum being paid in 1887 for additional ground. In 1897
the Great Central railway company conveyed a further portion
to the club, making the ground complete as it now is; the total
area is about 20 acres, including the site of various villas adjoining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
the ground which are part of the property. The number of
members now considerably exceeds five thousand.</p>

<p><i>Laws.</i>&mdash;The oldest laws of cricket extant are those drawn up by
the London Club in 1744. These were amended at the &ldquo;Star
and Garter&rdquo; in Pall Mall, London, in 1755, and again in 1774,
and were also revised by the M.C.C. in 1788. From this time
the latter club has been regarded as the supreme authority,
even though some local modifications have in recent years been
effected in Australia. Alterations and additions have been
frequently made, and according to the present procedure they
have to be approved by a majority of two-thirds of the members
present at the annual general meeting of the whole club; the
administration being in the hands of a president, annually
nominated by his outgoing predecessor, a treasurer and a
committee composed of sixteen members, four annually retiring,
in conjunction with a secretary and a large subordinate staff.</p>

<p><i>Implements.</i>&mdash;Concerning the implements of the game, in the
1744 rules it was declared that the weight of the ball must be
&ldquo;between five and six ounces,&rdquo; and it was not until 1774 that it
was decided that it &ldquo;shall weigh not less than five ounces and
a half nor more than five ounces and three-quarters,&rdquo; as it is
to the present day. Not until 1838 however came the addition,
&ldquo;it shall measure not less than nine inches nor more than nine
inches and a quarter in circumference.&rdquo; The materials out of
which the old balls were made are not on record. At present
a cube of cork forms the foundation, round which layers of fine
twine and thin shavings of cork are accumulated till the proper
size and shape are attained, when a covering of red leather is
sewn on with six parallel seams. Various &ldquo;compositions&rdquo;
have been tried as a substitute for cork and leather, but without
taking their place.</p>

<p>For the bat, English willow has been proverbially found the
best wood. The oldest extant bats resemble a broad and curved
hockey stick, and it has been claimed to be an evolution of the
club employed in the Irish game of &ldquo;hurley.&rdquo; The straight
blade was adopted as soon as the bowler began to pitch the ball
up, an alteration which took place about 1750, but pictures
show slightly curved bats almost to the time of the battle of
Waterloo. The oldest were all made in one piece and were
so used until the middle of the 19th century, when handles
of ash were spliced into the blade, and the whole cane-handle
was introduced about 1860. No limit was set to the length
of the bat until 1840, though the width was restricted to 4¼ in.
&ldquo;in the widest part&rdquo; by the laws of 1788, and a gauge was made
for the use of the Hambledon Club. The length of the bat is
now restricted to 38 in., 36 being more generally used, as a rule the
handle being 14 in. long and the blade 22 in. As to weight,
though there is no restriction, 2 &#8468; 3 oz. is considered light, 2 &#8468;
6 oz. fairly heavy; but W. Ward (1787-1849) used a bat weighing
4 &#8468;.</p>

<p>At present the wicket consists of three stumps (round straight
pieces of wood) of equal thickness, standing 27 in. upright out
of the ground. On the top are two &ldquo;bails,&rdquo; short pieces of
wood which fit into grooves made in the top of the stumps so
as not to project more than half an inch above them. But the
evolution of the wicket has been very gradual, and the history
of it is very obscure, since different types of wickets seem to
have existed simultaneously. If early pictures are to be trusted,
no wicket was required in primitive times: the striker was
either caught out, or run out, the fieldsman having to put the
ball into a hole scooped in the ground, before the batsman could
put his bat into it. A single stump, it is supposed, was sometimes
substituted for the hole to save collision between the bat and
the fieldsman&rsquo;s fingers. In due course, but at an unknown
date, a wicket&mdash;a &ldquo;skeleton gate&rdquo;&mdash;was raised over the hole;
it consisted of two stumps each 12 in. high, set 24 in. apart,
with a third laid on the top of them. John Nyren, however,
writing in 1833, and discussing some memoranda given him by
Mr W. Ward, says apropos of these dimensions, &ldquo;There must
be a mistake in this account of the width of the wicket.&rdquo; Undoubtedly
such wickets were all against the bowler, who must
have bowled over or through the wicket twenty times for every
occasion when he succeeded in hitting either the uprights or the
cross stump. In pictures of cricket played about 1743 we find
only two stumps and a cross stump, or bail, the wicket varying
apparently both in height and width. In a picture, the property
of H.M. the King, entitled &ldquo;A Village Match in 1768,&rdquo; three
stumps and a bail are distinctly shown. Two stumps are shown
as used in 1779, afterwards three always with one exception.
Two prints, advertisements, representing matches played
between women on consecutive days in 1811, show, one of them
a wicket of three stumps, the other a wicket of two. The addition
of the third stump, as is universally agreed, was due to an
incident which occurred in a match of the Hambledon Club in
1775. &ldquo;It was observed at a critical point in the game, that
the ball passed three times between Mr Small&rsquo;s two stumps
without knocking off the bail; and then, first a third stump
was added, and seeing that the new style of balls which rise
over the bat also rise over the wicket, then but 1 ft. high,
the wicket was altered to the dimensions of 22 in. by 8, and to
its present dimensions of 27 in. by 8 in 1817.&rdquo; So writes the Rev.
J. Pycroft (1813-1895), quoting fairly closely from Nyren, who
wrote many years after the event; but Pycroft is wrong in
writing 22 by 8, which should really be 22 by 6. It is hard to
believe that the 12 by 24 wicket lasted as long as 1775, for in the
laws issued after the meeting held at the &ldquo;Star and Garter,&rdquo;
Pall Mall, where many &ldquo;noblemen and gentlemen&rdquo; attended
&ldquo;finally to settle&rdquo; the laws of the game, we read that the
stumps are to be 22 in. and the bail 6. &ldquo;N.B.&mdash;It is lately settled
to use three stumps instead of two to each wicket, the bail the
same length as before.&rdquo; Regarding all the circumstances one
is tempted to believe that Small defended a wicket of two stumps,
22 in. high and 6 in. apart, strange as is the circumstance
that the ball should thrice in a short innings&mdash;for Small only
made 14 runs&mdash;pass through them without dislodging the bail,
even though the diameter of the ball is a trifle less than 3 in.
Allusion is also found to a wicket 12 in. by 6, but it is hard to
believe in its existence, unless it was used as a form of handicap.
It should be recorded that in advertisements of matches about
this time (1787) the fact that three stumps will be used &ldquo;to
shorten the game&rdquo; is especially mentioned, and that the <i>Hampshire
Chronicle</i> of the 15th of July 1797 records that &ldquo;The earl
of Winchilsea has made an improvement in the game of cricket,
by having four stumps instead of three, and the wickets 2 in.
higher. The game is thus rendered shorter by easier bowling
out.&rdquo; In 1788, however, when the M.C.C. revised the laws,
reference is made to stumps (no number given, but probably
three) 22 in. high and a bail of 6 in. Big scoring in 1796 caused
the addition next year of 2 in. to the height and of 1 to the
breadth, making the wicket 24 in. by 7. That three stumps
were employed is shown by a print of the medallion of the
Oxfordshire County C.C. 1797, forming the frontispiece to
Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Annals of Lord&rsquo;s</i> (1903). In 1817 the dimensions
now in use were finally settled, three stumps 27 in. high, and a
wicket 8 in. wide. Larger wickets have occasionally been used
by way of handicap or experiment. The distance between the
wickets seems always, or at least as far back as 1700, to have
been 22 yds.&mdash;one chain.</p>

<p><i>The Game.</i>&mdash;Cricket is defined in the <i>New English Dictionary</i> as
&ldquo;an open-air game played with bats, ball and wickets by two
sides of eleven players each; the batsman defends his wicket
against the ball which is bowled by a player of the opposing side,
the other players of this side being stationed about the field in
order to catch or stop the ball.&rdquo; The laws define that the score
shall be reckoned by runs. The side which scores the greatest
number of runs wins the match. Each side has two innings
taken alternately, except that the side which leads by 150 runs
in a three days&rsquo; match or by 100 runs in a two days&rsquo; match or
by 75 runs in a one day match shall have the option of requiring
the other side to &ldquo;follow their innings.&rdquo; In England cricket
is invariably played on turf wickets, but in the Colonies matting
wickets are often employed, and sometimes matches have taken
place on sand, earth and other substances. The oldest form
of the game is probably single wicket, which consists of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
batsman defending one wicket, but this has become obsolete,
though it was very popular in the time when matches were
played for money with only one or two, or perhaps four or five,
players on a side. Matches between an unequal number of
players are still sometimes arranged, but mainly in the case of
local sides against touring teams, or &ldquo;colts&rdquo; playing against
eleven experienced cricketers. In any case two umpires are
always appointed, and for English first-class county cricket
these are now annually chosen beforehand by the county captains.
Two scorers are officially recognized. All the arrangements as
to scoreboards, and accommodation for players, members of the
club and general spectators, vary considerably according to
local requirements. Between six and seven acres forms the most
suitable area for a match, but the size of a cricket ground has
never been defined by law.</p>

<p>The wickets are pitched opposite and parallel to one another
at a distance of 22 yds.; the &ldquo;bowling crease&rdquo; being
marked with whitewash on the turf on a line with the stumps
8 ft. 8 in. in length, with short &ldquo;return creases&rdquo; at right
angles to it at each end; but the &ldquo;popping crease,&rdquo; marked
parallel to the wicket and 4 ft. in front of it, is deemed
of unlimited length. The captains of the opposing sides toss for
choice of innings, and the winner of the toss, though occasionally,
owing to the condition of the ground or the weather prospects,
electing to put his adversaries in first, as a general rule elects for
his own side to bat first. The captain of the batting side sends
his eleven (or whatever the number of his team may be) in to
bat in any order he thinks best, and much judgment is used in
deciding what this order shall be. Two batsmen with strong
defensive powers and good nerve are usually selected to open
the innings, the most brilliant run-getters immediately following
them, and the weakest batsmen going in last. As there must
always, except in the obsolete single-wicket cricket, be two
batsmen in together, it follows that when ten of the side (in a
side of eleven) have been put out, one of the final pair must be
&ldquo;not out&rdquo;; that is to say, his innings is terminated without
his getting out because there is none of his side left to become
his partner. The batsman who is thus &ldquo;not out&rdquo; is said to
&ldquo;carry his bat,&rdquo; a phrase that recalls a period when two bats
sufficed for the whole side, each retiring batsman leaving the
implement on the ground for the use of his successor, till at the
close of the innings the &ldquo;not out&rdquo; man carried it back to the
tent or pavilion. As the phrase is not also applied to the last
batsman to get out, who would of course have carried the second
bat off the ground, it was possibly at one time restricted to a
player who going in first survived through the whole innings.
It should be observed that the term &ldquo;wicket&rdquo; is used by
cricketers in a number of different senses. Besides being the
name given to the set of three stumps with their two bails when
pitched for a match, it is in an extended sense applied to that
portion of the ground, also called the &ldquo;pitch,&rdquo; on which the
stumps are pitched, as when it is described as being &ldquo;a fast
wicket,&rdquo; a &ldquo;sticky wicket&rdquo; and so forth. It also in several
idiomatic expressions signifies the getting out of a batsman
and even the batsman himself, as in the phrases: &ldquo;Grace lost
his wicket without scoring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grace went in first wicket down,&rdquo;
&ldquo;when Grace got out England lost their best wicket,&rdquo; &ldquo;England
beat Australia by two wickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The umpires are required to decide questions arising in the
course of play and to call the &ldquo;overs,&rdquo; the &ldquo;over&rdquo; being a series
of successive deliveries of the ball (usually six) by the bowler
from one end of the pitch, the rest of the &ldquo;out&rdquo; side, or fielders,
being stationed in various positions in the field according to
well-defined principles. When an &ldquo;over&rdquo; has been bowled
from one end a different bowler then bowls an &ldquo;over&rdquo; from the
opposite end, the alternation being continued without interruption
throughout the innings, and the bowlers being selected and
changed from time to time by the captain of their side at his
discretion. At the end of every over the fielders &ldquo;change over&rdquo;
or otherwise rearrange their places to meet the batting from
the other end. An over from which no runs are made off the
bat is called a &ldquo;maiden.&rdquo; A &ldquo;run&rdquo; is made when the two
batsmen change places, each running from his own to the opposite
wicket without being &ldquo;run out.&rdquo; The aim of the batting side
is to make as many runs as possible, while the object of the
fielding side is to get their opponents out, and to prevent their
making runs while in.</p>

<p>There are nine ways in which the batsman, or &ldquo;striker,&rdquo; can
be put out. Of these the following five are the most important.
(1) The striker is &ldquo;bowled&rdquo; out if the bowler hits the wicket
with the ball, when bowling, and dislodges the bail; (2) he is
&ldquo;caught&rdquo; out if the ball after touching his bat or hand be held
by any member of the fielding side before it touches the ground;
(3) he is &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; out if the wicket-keeper dislodges the bail
with the ball, or with his hand holding the ball, at a moment
when the striker in playing at the ball has no part of his person
or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease,
<i>i.e.</i> when the batsman is &ldquo;out of his ground&rdquo;; (4) he is out
&ldquo;l.b.w.&rdquo; (leg before wicket) if he stops with any part of his
person other than his hand, or arm below the elbow, a ball
which in the umpire&rsquo;s judgment pitched straight between the
wickets, and would have bowled the striker&rsquo;s wicket; (5) if
when the batsmen are attempting to make a run a wicket
is put down (<i>i.e.</i> the bail dislodged) by the ball, or by the hand
of any fieldsman holding the ball, at a moment when neither
batsman has any part of his person or bat on the ground behind
the popping crease, the nearer of the two batsmen to the wicket
so put down is &ldquo;run out.&rdquo; The remaining four ways in which
a batsman may be dismissed are (6) hit wicket, (7) handling the
ball, (8) hitting the ball more than once &ldquo;with intent to score,&rdquo;
and (9) obstructing the field.</p>

<p>The positions of the fieldsmen are those which experience proves
to be best adapted for the purpose of saving runs and getting
the batsmen caught out. During the middle of the 19th century
these positions became almost stereotyped according to the pace
of the bowler&rsquo;s delivery and whether the batsmen were right
or left handed. A certain number of fielders stood on the &ldquo;on&rdquo;
side, <i>i.e.</i> the side of the wicket on which the batsman stands, and
a certain number on the opposite or &ldquo;off&rdquo; side, towards which
the batsman faces. &ldquo;Point&rdquo; almost invariably was placed
square with the striker&rsquo;s wicket some ten or a dozen yards
distant on the &ldquo;off&rdquo; side; &ldquo;cover point&rdquo; to the right of
&ldquo;point&rdquo; (as he is looking towards the batsman) and several
yards deeper; &ldquo;mid on&rdquo; a few yards to the right of the bowler,
and &ldquo;mid off&rdquo; in a corresponding position on his left, and so
forth. Good captains at all times exercised judgment in modifying
to some extent the arrangement of the field according to
circumstances, but in this respect much was learnt from the
Australians, who on their first visit to England in 1878 varied
the positions of the field according to the idiosyncrasies of the
batsmen and other exigencies to a degree not previously practised
in England. The perfection of wicket-keeping displayed by
the Australian, McCarthy Blackham (b. 1855), taught English
cricketers that on modern grounds the &ldquo;long stop&rdquo; could
be altogether dispensed with; and this position, which in
former days was considered a necessary and important one,
has since been practically abolished. In many matches at the
present day, owing to the character of modern bowling, no more
than a single fieldsman is placed on the &ldquo;on&rdquo; side, while the
number and positions of those &ldquo;in the slips,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> behind the
wicket on the &ldquo;off&rdquo; side, are subject to no sort of rule, but vary
according to the nature of the bowling, the state of the ground,
or any other circumstances that may influence the judgment
of the captain of the fielding side. Charts such as were once
common, showing the positions of the fielders for fast, slow and
medium bowling respectively, would therefore to-day give no
true idea of the actual practice; and much of the skill of modern
captaincy is shown in placing the field.</p>

<p>The score is compiled by runs made by the batsman and by the
addition of &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; the latter consisting of &ldquo;byes,&rdquo; &ldquo;leg-byes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;wides&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-balls.&rdquo; All these are included in the
designation &ldquo;runs,&rdquo; of which the total score is composed, though
neither &ldquo;wides&rdquo; nor &ldquo;no-balls&rdquo; involve any actual run on the
part of the batsmen. They are called by the umpire on his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
initiative, in the one case if the bowler&rsquo;s delivery passes the
batsman beyond the reach of his bat (&ldquo;wide&rdquo;), and in the other
if he delivers the ball without having either foot touching the
ground behind the &ldquo;bowling crease&rdquo; and within the &ldquo;return
crease,&rdquo; or if the ball be jerked or thrown instead of being <i>bona
fide</i> &ldquo;bowled.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wides&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-balls&rdquo; count as one &ldquo;run&rdquo;
each, and all &ldquo;extras&rdquo; are added to the score of the side without
being credited to any individual batsman. The batsman may,
however, hit a &ldquo;no-ball&rdquo; and make runs off it, the runs so made
being scored to the striker&rsquo;s credit instead of the &ldquo;no-ball&rdquo;
being entered among the &ldquo;extras.&rdquo; The batsman may be &ldquo;run
out&rdquo; in attempting a run off a &ldquo;no-ball,&rdquo; but cannot be put out
off it in any other way. &ldquo;Byes&rdquo; are runs made off a ball which
touches neither the bat nor the person of the batsman, &ldquo;leg-byes&rdquo;
off a ball which, without touching the bat or hand, touches any
other part of his person. With the exception of these &ldquo;extras&rdquo;
the score consists entirely of runs made off the bat.</p>

<p>Batting is the most scientific feature of the game. Proficiency
in it, as in golf and tennis, depends in the first instance to a great
extent on the player assuming a correct attitude for
making his stroke, the position of leg, shoulder and
<span class="sidenote">Batting.</span>
elbow being a matter of importance; and although a quick and
accurate eye may occasionally be sufficient by itself to make a
tolerably successful run-getter, good style can never be acquired,
and a consistently high level of achievement can seldom be
gained, by a batsman who has neglected these rudiments. Good
batting consists in a defence that is proof against all the bowler&rsquo;s
craft, combined with the skill to seize every opportunity for
making runs that the latter may inadvertently offer. If the
batsman&rsquo;s whole task consisted in keeping the ball out of his
wicket, the accomplishment of his art would be comparatively
simple; it is the necessity for doing this while at the same time he
must prevent the ball from rising off his bat into the air in the
direction of any one of eleven skilfully-placed fielders, each eager
to catch him out, that offers scope for the science of a Grace, a
MacLaren or a Trumper. In early days when the wickets were
low and the ball was trundled along the ground, the curved bats of
the old pictures were probably well adapted for hitting, defence
being neglected; but when the height of the wickets was raised,
and bowlers began to pitch the ball closer to the batsman so that
it would reach the wicket on the first bound, defence of the wicket
became more necessary and more difficult. Hence the modern
straight-bladed bat was produced, and a more scientific method of
batting became possible. Batting and bowling have in fact
developed together, a new form of attack requiring a new form of
defence. One of the first principles a young batsman has to
learn is to play with a &ldquo;a straight bat&rdquo; when defending his wicket
against straight balls. This means that the whole blade of the
bat should be equally opposite to the line on which the ball is
travelling towards him, in order that the ball, to whatever height
it may bound from the ground, may meet the bat unless it
rises altogether over the batsman&rsquo;s hands; the tendency of the
untutored cricketer being on the contrary to hold the bat sloping
outwards from the handle to the point, as the golf-player holds his
&ldquo;driver,&rdquo; so that the rise of the ball is apt to carry it clear of the
blade. Standing then in a correct position and playing with a
straight bat, the batsman&rsquo;s chief concern is to calculate accurately
the &ldquo;length&rdquo; of the ball as soon as he sees it leave the bowler&rsquo;s
hand. The &ldquo;length&rdquo; of the ball means the distance from the
batsman at which it pitches, and &ldquo;good length&rdquo; is the first
essential of the bowler&rsquo;s art. The distance that <span class="correction" title="amended from consistutes">constitutes</span>
&ldquo;good length&rdquo; is not, however, to be defined by precise measurement;
it depends on the condition of the ground, and on the
reach of the batsman. A &ldquo;good-length ball&rdquo; is one that pitches
too far from the batsman for him to reach out to meet it with the
bat at the moment it touches the ground or immediately it begins
to rise, in the manner known as &ldquo;playing forward&rdquo;; and at the
same time not far enough from him to enable him to wait till after
it has reached the highest point in its bound before playing it
with the bat, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;playing back.&rdquo; When, owing to the good
length of the ball, the batsman is unable to play it in either of
these two ways, but is compelled to play at it in the middle of its
rise from the ground, he is almost certain, if he does not miss it
altogether, to send it up in the air with the danger of being caught
out. If through miscalculation the batsman plays forward to a
short-pitched ball, he will probably give a catch to the bowler or
&ldquo;mid off,&rdquo; if he plays back to a well-pitched-up ball, he will
probably miss it and be bowled out. The bowler is therefore
continually trying to pitch balls just too short for safe forward
play, while the batsman defends his wicket by playing forward
or back as his judgment directs so long as the bowling is straight
and of approximately good length, and is ready the instant he
receives a bad-length ball, or one safely wide of the wicket, to hit it
along the ground clear of the fieldsmen so as to make as many
runs as he and his partner can accomplish before the ball is
returned to the wicket-keeper or the bowler. But even those
balls off which runs are scored are not to be hit recklessly or
without scientific method. A different stroke is brought into
requisition according to the length of the ball and its distance
wide of the wicket to the &ldquo;off&rdquo; or &ldquo;on&rdquo; as the case may be; and
the greatest batsmen are those who with an almost impregnable
defence combine the greatest variety of strokes, which as occasion
demands they can make with confidence and certainty. There
are, however, comparatively few cricketers who do not excel in
some particular strokes more than in others. One will make most
of his runs by &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; past &ldquo;point,&rdquo; or by wrist strokes behind
the wicket, while others, like the famous Middlesex Etonian
C. I. Thornton, and the Australian C. J. Bonnor, depend mainly
on powerful &ldquo;drives&rdquo; into the deep field behind the bowler&rsquo;s
wicket. Some again, though proficient in all-round play, develop
exceptional skill in some one stroke which other first-class players
seldom attempt. A good illustration is the &ldquo;glance stroke&rdquo; off
the legs which K. S. Ranjitsinhji made with such ease and grace.
All great cricketers in fact, while observing certain general
principles, display some individuality of style, and a bowler who
is familiar with a batsman&rsquo;s play is often aware of some idiosyncrasy
of which he can take advantage in his attack.</p>

<p>Bowling is, indeed, scarcely less scientific than batting. It is
not, however, so systematically taught to young amateurs, and
it may be partly in consequence of this neglect that
amateur bowling is exceedingly weak in England as
<span class="sidenote">Bowling.</span>
compared with that of professionals. The evolution of the art
of bowling, for it has been an evolution, is an interesting chapter
in the history of cricket which can only be briefly outlined here.
The fundamental law as to the proper mode of the bowler&rsquo;s
delivering the ball is that the ball must be bowled, not thrown
or jerked. When bowling underhand along the ground was
superseded by &ldquo;length bowling,&rdquo; it was found that the ball
might be caused, by jerking, to travel at a pace which on the
rough grounds was considered dangerous; hence the law against
jerking, which was administered practically by chalking the inside
of the bowler&rsquo;s elbow; if a chalk mark was found on his side,
the ball was not allowed as fair. The necessity of keeping the
elbow away from the side led gradually to the extension of the
arm horizontally and to round-arm bowling, the invention of
which is usually attributed to John Wills (or Willes; b. 1777)
of Kent and Sussex. Nyren, however, says &ldquo;Tom Walker
(about 1790) began the system of throwing instead of bowling
now so much the fashion&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;The first I recollect seeing
revive this fashion was Wills, a Sussex man,&rdquo; the date of the
revival being 1807. Walker was no-balled. Beldham (1766-1862)
says, &ldquo;The law against jerking was owing to the frightful
pace Tom Walker put on, and I believe that he afterwards
tried something more like the modern throwing-bowling. Willes
was not the inventor of that kind, or round-arm bowling. He
only revived what was forgotten or new to the young folk.&rdquo;
Curiously enough, Beldham also writes of the same Tom Walker
that he was &ldquo;the first lobbing slow bowler&rdquo; he ever saw,
and that he &ldquo;did feel so ashamed of such baby bowling, but
after all he did more than even David Harris himself.&rdquo; Round-arm
bowling was long and vigorously opposed, especially in 1826
when three matches were arranged between England and Sussex,
the Sussex bowlers being round-arm bowlers. When England
had lost the first two matches, nine of the professionals refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>440</span>
to take part in the third, &ldquo;unless the Sussex bowlers bowl fair,
that is, abstain from throwing.&rdquo; Five of them did play and
Sussex lost, but the new style of bowling had indicated its
existence. In 1844 the M.C.C.&rsquo;s revised law reads, &ldquo;The ball
must be bowled, not thrown or jerked, and the hand must not
be above the shoulder in delivery.&rdquo; Round-arm bowling was
thenceforth legal. In 1862 Willsher (1828-1885), the Kent
bowler, was no-balled by the umpire (Lillywhite) for raising his
hand too high, amid a scene of excitement that almost equalled
a tumult. Overhand bowling was legalized on the 10th of June
1864 after strenuous opposition. In early days much importance
was attached to great pace, but the success of the slow lobbing
bowling (pitched up underhand) led to its cultivation; in both
styles some of the best performers delivered the ball with a
curious high action, thrusting the ball, as it were, from close under
the arm-pit. When the advantages of bias (or twist, or break)
were first known is not closely recorded, but we read of one
Lamborn who (about 1800) could make the ball break from leg
so that &ldquo;the Kent and Surrey men could not tell what to make
of that cursed twist of his.&rdquo; Whatever the pace of bowling,
accuracy is the essential point, or, more correctly, the power of
accurately varying pace, pitch and direction, so that the batsman
is never at peace. If the bowler is a mere machine, the batsman
soon becomes his master; but the question as to which of the
two is supreme depends very largely on the condition of the
turf, whether it be hard and true, soft and wet, hard and rough
or soft and drying: the first pair of conditions favour the batsmen,
the second pair the bowler.</p>

<p>The immense amount of labour and expense devoted to the
preparation and care of cricket grounds has produced during
the past quarter of a century a perfection of smoothness in the
turf which has materially altered the character of the game. On
the rough and fiery pitches of earlier days, on which a &ldquo;long
stop&rdquo; was indispensable, the behaviour of the ball could not be
reckoned upon by the batsman with any degree of confidence.
The first ball of an &ldquo;over&rdquo; might be a &ldquo;shooter,&rdquo; never rising
as much as an inch off the ground, the next might bound over
his head, and the third pursue some equally eccentric course.
But on the best grounds of to-day, subject to the well-understood
changes due to weather, the bound of the ball is so regular as
to be calculable with reasonable certainty by the batsman.
The result has been that in fine weather, when wickets are true
and fast, bowlers have become increasingly powerless to defeat
the batsmen. In other words the defence has been strengthened
out of proportion to the attack. Bowlers have consequently to
a great extent abandoned all attempt to bowl the wicket down,
aiming instead at effecting their purpose by bowling close to but
clear of the wicket, with the design of getting the batsman to
give catches. Many batsmen of the stubbornly defensive type,
known in cricket slang as &ldquo;stonewallers,&rdquo; retaliated by leaving
such balls alone together, or stopping them deliberately with the
legs instead of the bat.</p>

<p>These tactics caused the game to become very slow; over after
over was bowled without an attempt being made to score a run
and without apparent prospect of getting a wicket. This not
only injured the popularity of the game from the spectator&rsquo;s
point of view, but, in conjunction with the enormous scores that
became common in dry seasons, made it so difficult to finish a
match within the three days to which first-class matches in
England are invariably limited, that nearly 70% of the total
number of fixtures in some seasons were drawn. Cricketers of
an older generation have complained that the cause of this is
partly to be found in the amount of time wasted by contemporary
cricketers. These critics see no reason why half of a summer&rsquo;s
day should be allowed to elapse before cricket begins, and they
comment with some scorn on the interval for tea, and the
fastidiousness with which play is frequently interrupted on
account of imperfect light or for other unimperative reasons.
Various suggestions have been made, including proposals for
enlarging the wicket, for enabling the attack to hold its own
against the increasing strength of the defence. But the M.C.C.,
the only recognized source of cricket legislation, has displayed
a cautious but wise conservatism, due to the fact that its authority
rests on no sanction more formal than that of prestige tacitly
admitted by the cricketing world; and consequently no drastic
changes have been made in the laws of the game, the only important
amendments of recent years being that which now
permits a side to close its innings voluntarily under certain
conditions, and that which, in substitution for the former hard
and fast rule for the &ldquo;follow on,&rdquo; has given an option in the
matter to the side possessing the requisite lead on the first
innings.</p>

<p><i>Early Players.</i>&mdash;If the era of the present form of cricket can
very properly be dated from the visit of the first Australian team
to England in 1878, some enumeration must be made of a few of
the cricketers who took part in first-class matches in the earlier
portion of the 19th century. Among amateurs should be noted
the two fast bowlers, Sir F. H. Bathurst (1807-1881; Eton,
Hampshire), and Harvey Fellowes (b. 1826; Eton); the
batsman N. Felix (1804-1876; Surrey and Kent), who was
a master of &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; and one of the earliest to adopt batting
gloves; the cricketing champion of his time Alfred Mynn (1807-1861;
Kent); and the keen player F. P. Miller (1828-1875;
Surrey). The three Marshams, Rev. C. D. Marsham (b. 1835),
R. H. B. Marsham (b. 1833) and G. Marsham (b. 1849), all of
Eton and Oxford, were as famous as the Studds in the &rsquo;eighties;
and R. Hankey (1832-1886; Harrow and Oxford) was a great
scorer. In the next generation one of the greatest bats of his
own or any time was R. A. H. Mitchell (1843-1905; Eton, Oxford,
Hants). A very attractive run-getter was C. F. Buller (b.
1846; Harrow, Middlesex); an all too brief career was that
of C. J. Ottaway (1850-1878; Eton, Oxford, Kent and Middlesex);
whilst A. Lubbock (b. 1845; Eton, Kent) was a sound bat,
and D. Buchanan (1830-1900; Rugby and Cambridge) a destructive
bowler, as was also A. Appleby (1843-1902; Lancashire).</p>

<p>Of the professionals, Fuller Pilch (1803-1870) and E. G.
Wenman (1803-1897) were great bats; T. Box (1808-1876) the
most skilled wicket-keeper of his time; W. Lillywhite (1792-
1854), one of the first round-arm bowlers, renowned for the
accuracy of his pitch, and W. Clark (1798-1856) possessed
wonderful variety of pace and pitch. It was the last-named who
organized the All England Eleven, and he was not chosen to
represent the players until he had reached the age of forty-seven.
George Parr (1826-1891), the greatest leg-hitter in England, had
no professional rival until the advent of Richard Daft (1835-
1900). J. Dean (1816-1891) was the finest long-stop, Julius
Caesar (1830-1878) a hard clean hitter, as was G. Anderson (1826-1902),
and T. Lockyer (1826-1869) seems to have been the first
prominent wicket-keeper who took balls wide on the leg-side.
Of bowlers, E. Willsher (1828-1885) would seem to have been the
most difficult, W. Martingell (1818-1897) being a very good
medium-paced bowler, and J. Wisden (1826-1884) a very fast
bowler but short in his length. Four famous bowlers of a later
date are George Freeman (1844-1895), J. Jackson (1833-1901),
G. Tarrant (1838-1870) and G. Wootton (b. 1834). With them
must be mentioned the great batsmen, T. Hayward (1835-1876)
and R. Carpenter (1830-1901), as well as two other keen cricketers,
H. H. Stephenson (1833-1896) and T. Hearne (1826-1900).</p>

<p>Since the first half of the 19th century the sort of cricket to
engage public attention has very greatly changed, and the change
has become emphasized since the exchange of visits between
Australian and English teams has become an established feature
of first-class cricket. First-class cricket has become more formal,
more serious and more spectacular. The contest for the county
championship has introduced an annual competition, closely
followed by the public, between standing rivals familiar with each
other&rsquo;s play and record; an increased importance has become
attached to &ldquo;averages&rdquo; and &ldquo;records,&rdquo; and it is felt by some
that the purely sporting side of the game has been damaged by
the change. Professionalism has increased, and it is an open
secret that not a few players who appear before the public as
amateurs derive an income under some pretext or other from
the game. Cricket on the village green has in many parts of the
country almost ceased to exist, while immense crowds congregate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>441</span>
to watch county matches in the great towns; but this must no
doubt be in part attributed to the movement of population from
the country districts; and some compensation is to be found in
league cricket (see below), and in the numerous clubs for the
employees of business firms and large shops, and for the members
of social institutes of all kinds, which play matches in the suburbs
of London and other cities. At an earlier period two great professional
organizations, &ldquo;The All England,&rdquo; formed in 1846, and
&ldquo;The United All England,&rdquo; toured the country, mainly for profit,
playing local sides in which &ldquo;given men,&rdquo; generally good professional
players, figured. They did much good work in popularizing
the game, and an annual match between the two at
Lord&rsquo;s on Whit-Monday was once a great feature of the season;
but the increase of county cricket led eventually to their
disbandment.</p>

<p>At this period, and much later, the first-class matches of
&ldquo;M.C.C. and ground&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> ground-staff, or professionals attached
to the club) occupied a far greater amount of importance than is
at present the case. In recent years over 150 minor matches of
the utmost value in propagating the best interests of cricket are
annually played by the leading club. League cricket has of late
become exceedingly popular, especially in the North of England,
a number of clubs&mdash;about twelve to sixteen&mdash;combining to form
a &ldquo;League&rdquo; and playing home-and-home matches, each one
with each of the others in turn; points are scored according as
each club wins, loses, or draws matches, the championship of the
&ldquo;League&rdquo; being thus decided.</p>

<p><i>English County Cricket.</i>&mdash;The first English inter-county
match which is recorded was played on Richmond Green in
1730 between Surrey and Middlesex; but for very many years,
though counties played counties, there was no systematic organization,
matches often being played at odds or with &ldquo;given&rdquo;
players, who had no county connexion with the side they represented.
This was the natural outcome of the custom of playing
for stakes. It was not till 1872 that any real effort was made
to organize county cricket. In that year the M.C.C. took the
initiative by offering a cup for competition between the counties,
six of which were to be selected by the M.C.C., the matches to
be played at Lord&rsquo;s, but the scheme fell through owing to the
coolness of the counties themselves. It was only in 1890 that the
counties were formally and officially classified, Notts (the county
club dating from 1859), Lancashire (1864), Surrey (1845), Kent
(1842), Middlesex (1864), Gloucestershire (1869), Yorkshire
(1862), and Sussex (1839), being regarded as &ldquo;first-class,&rdquo; as
indeed had been the case from the time of their existence; and
by degrees other counties were promoted to this class; Somerset
in 1893; Derbyshire, Essex, Leicestershire, Warwickshire in
1894; Hampshire in 1895; Worcestershire in 1899; Northamptonshire
in 1905.</p>

<p>In 1887 the County Cricket Council had been formed, working
with and not against the Marylebone Club, for the management
of county cricket, but the council dissolved itself in 1890, and
it was then arranged that the county secretaries and delegates
should meet and discuss such matters, and request the M.C.C. to
consider the result of their deliberations, and practically to act
as patron and arbitrator. In 1905 an Advisory Cricket Committee
was formed &ldquo;with the co-operation of the counties, with
a view to improve the procedure in dealing with important
matters arising out of the development of cricket, the effect of
which will be&rdquo; (the quotation is from the annual report of M.C.C.
in 1905) &ldquo;to bring the counties into closer touch with the
M.C.C.&rdquo; Various methods have been tried as to the assignment
of points or marks, the following being the list of champion
counties up to 1909:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>English county cricket is now the most firmly established cricketing
institution in the world, but in its earlier stages it owed much in
different counties to enthusiastic individuals and famous
cricketing families whose energies were devoted to its
<span class="sidenote">The Graces and Gloucestershire.</span>
encouragement and support. To Gloucestershire belongs
the honour of the greatest name in the history of the game.
Dr W. G. Grace (<i>q.v.</i>) was not only the most brilliant all-round
cricketer in the world, but he remained supreme after reaching
an age when most cricketers have long abandoned the game. He
and his two famous brothers, E. M. Grace (b. 1841) and G. F. Grace
(1850-1880), rendered invaluable service to their county for many
years; and not to their county alone, for the great part they played
for a generation in first-class cricket did much to increase the growing
popularity of the county fixtures. A separate article is devoted to
Dr W. G. Grace, whose name as the champion of the game will
always be associated with its history. And of Dr E. M. Grace it
may be mentioned that, besides being the most daring field at
&ldquo;point&rdquo; ever seen, he altogether took 11,092 wickets and scored
75,625 runs. In more recent years some excellent cricketers
have been associated with Gloucestershire, such as F. Townsend,
and the professional Board; but foremost stands G. L. Jessop,
a somewhat &ldquo;unorthodox&rdquo; batsman famous for his powers of
hitting.</p>

<p>What W. G. Grace did for Gloucestershire, Lord Harris (b. 1851)
did for Kent, and his services are not to be estimated by his performances
in the field alone, great as they were. His influence
was always exerted to impart a spirit of sportsmanship
<span class="sidenote">Kent.</span>
and honourable distinction to the national game. Kent had been a
home of cricket since the first half of the 18th century, but it was
Lord Harris more than any other individual who made it a first-class
county, celebrated for the number of distinguished amateurs who
have taken part in its matches. The Hon. Ivo Bligh, afterwards
Lord Darnley (b. 1859), and F. Marchant (b. 1864), both Etonians
like Lord Harris himself; the two Harrovians, W. H. Patterson
(b. 1859) and M. C. Kemp (b. 1862), and the Wykehamist J. R.
Mason (b. 1874) are names that show the place taken by public
school men in the annals of Kent cricket, while the family of Hearnes
supplied the county with some famous professionals. Amateur
batsmen like W. Rashleigh, C. J. Burnup, E. W. Dillon and A. P.
Day have been prominent in the Kent eleven; and in Fielder and
Blythe they have had two first-class professional bowlers. The
&ldquo;Kent nursery&rdquo; at Tonbridge has proved a valuable institution for
training young professional players, and contributed not a little to
the rising reputation of Kent, which justified itself when the county
won the championship in 1906, largely owing to the admirable
batting of the amateur K. L. Hutchings.</p>

<p>Middlesex and Lancashire, not less than Kent, have been indebted
to the great public schools, and especially to Harrow, which provided
both counties with famous captains who directed their
fortunes for an uninterrupted period of over twenty years.
<span class="sidenote">Middlesex and Lancashire.</span>
I. D. Walker, the most celebrated of seven cricketing
brothers, all Harrovians, who founded the Middlesex
County Club, handed on the captaincy, after a personal record of
astonishing brilliancy, to a younger Harrow and Oxford cricketer,
A. J. Webbe, who was one of the finest leg-hitters and one of the
safest out-fielders of his day, and a captain of consummate judgment
and knowledge of the game. A. N. Hornby, a contemporary at
Harrow of I. D. Walker, was for many years the soul of Lancashire
cricket, and was succeeded in the captaincy of the county by the
still more famous Harrovian, A. C. MacLaren, one of the greatest
batsmen in the history of cricket, whose record for England in test
matches against Australia was almost unrivalled. In 1895, when he
headed the batting averages, MacLaren made the highest individual
score in a first-class match, viz. 424 against Somersetshire. Middlesex
has also the distinction of having produced the two greatest amateur
wicket-keepers in the history of English cricket, namely, the Hon.
Alfred Lyttelton (b. 1857) and Gregor MacGregor, both of whom,
after playing for Cambridge University, gave their services to the
Metropolitan county; while Lancashire can boast of the greatest
professional wicket-keeper in Richard Pilling (1855-1891), whose
reputation has not been eclipsed by that of the most proficient of
more recent years. Another famous Cambridge University cricketer,
a contemporary of Lyttelton, who was invaluable to Lancashire for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>
some years when he was one of the very finest all-round cricketers
in the country, was A. G. Steel (b. 1858), equally brilliant as a batsman
and as a slow bowler; and other names memorable in Lancashire
cricket were R. G. Barlow (b. 1859), whose stubborn batting
was a striking contrast to the rapid run-getting of Hornby and the
perfect style of Steel; John Briggs (1862-1902), whose slow left-hand
bowling placed him at the head of the bowling averages in
1890; John Crossland (1853-1903) and A. Mold (b. 1865), both of
whom were destructive fast bowlers; J. T. Tyldesley and R. H.
Spooner, both among the most brilliant batsmen of a later generation;
and W. Brearley, the amateur fast bowler.</p>

<p>Middlesex, like Kent, has been better served by amateurs than
professionals. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of J. T. Hearne,
who headed the bowling averages in 1891, 1896 and 1898, and of the
imported Australian A. E. Trott, few professionals of high merit are
conspicuously associated with the history of the county cricket.
Trott, in 1899 and again in 1900, performed the previously unprecedented
feat of taking over two hundred wickets and scoring over
one thousand runs in the same season. And in his &ldquo;benefit match&rdquo;
in May 1907 at Lord&rsquo;s he achieved the &ldquo;hat trick&rdquo; twice in one
innings, taking first four and then three wickets with successive
balls. But if there has been a dearth of professionals in Middlesex
cricket, the county has produced an abundance of celebrated
amateurs. In addition to the Walkers and A. J. Webbe, the metropolitan
county was the home of the celebrated hitter, C. I. Thornton,
and of the Studd family, who learnt their cricket at Eton and
Cambridge University. C. T. Studd, one of the most polished
batsmen who ever played cricket, was at the same time an excellent
medium-paced bowler, and his brother G. B. Studd is remembered
especially for his fielding, though like his elder brother, J. E. K.
Studd, he was an all-round cricketer of the greatest value to a
county team. Sir T. C. O&rsquo;Brien, who made his reputation by a fine
innings for Oxford University against the Australian team of 1882,
sustained it in the following years by many brilliant performances
for Middlesex. A. E. Stoddart for several years was the best run-getter
in the Middlesex eleven; and W. J. Ford and his younger
brother, F. G. J. Ford, were conspicuous among many prominent
Middlesex batsmen. In more recent times the Oxonian P. F. Warner
(b. 1873), both as captain and as batsman, did splendid work; and
B. J. T. Bosanquet, besides assisting powerfully with the bat,
became famous for inaugurating a new style of curly bowling
(&ldquo;googlies&rdquo;) of a very effective type.</p>

<p>A glance at the table given above shows the high place occupied
by Surrey in the past. Surrey county cricket can be traced as far
back as 1730. Pycroft observes that &ldquo;the name of Surrey
as one united county club is quite lost in the annals of
<span class="sidenote">Surrey.</span>
cricket from 1817 to 1845.&rdquo; But before that date two of the most
celebrated cricketers, William Lillywhite and Fuller Pilch, had
occasionally played for the county, and so also had James Broadbridge
(1796-1843) and W. Lambert (1779-1851). Kennington Oval
became the Surrey county ground in 1845, the property being leased
from the duchy of Cornwall; and in the years immediately following
the county team included H. H. Stephenson (1833-1896), Caffyn
(b. 1828), N. Felix, and Lockyer (1826-1869); among a later generation
appeared such well-remembered names as Jupp, Southerton,
Pooley and R. Humphrey. After being champion county in 1873,
Surrey did not again attain the same position for fourteen years,
but for the next ten years maintained an almost uninterrupted
supremacy. The greatest credit was due to the energetic direction
of J. Shuter (b. 1855), who kept together a remarkable combination
of cricketers, such as W. W. Read (1855-1906), Maurice Read (b.
1859), George Lohmann (1865-1901), and Robert Abel (b. 1859),
all of whom were among the greatest players of their period. Lohmann
in 1885-1890 would alone have made any side famous; and
in the same years when he was heading the bowling averages and
proving himself the most deadly bowler in the country, W. W. Read
was performing prodigies of batting. No sooner did the latter begin
to decline in power than Abel took his place at the head of the
batting averages, scoring with astonishing consistency in 1897-1900.
In 1899 he made 357 not out in an innings against Somersetshire,
and in 1901 his aggregate of 3309 was the largest then compiled.
The Oxonian K. J. Key was another famous batsman whose services
as captain were also exceedingly valuable to the county. An almost
inexhaustible supply of professionals of the very highest class has
been at Surrey&rsquo;s service. W. Lockwood (b. 1868) became almost as
deadly a bowler as Lohmann, and Tom Richardson (b. 1870) was the
terror of all Surrey&rsquo;s opponents for several seasons after 1893.
Richardson took in all no less than 1340 wickets at the cost of 20,000
runs. Tom Hayward (b. 1867), nephew of the renowned Cambridge
professional of the same name, succeeded Abel as the leading Surrey
batsman, his play in the test matches of 1899, when he averaged 65,
being superb. During the following years his reputation was fully
maintained, and in 1906 he had a particularly successful season.
Key was followed in the captaincy by D. L. A. Jephson, but the
county did not in the opening years of the 20th century maintain
the high place it occupied during the last quarter of the 19th. It
possessed some excellent professionals, however, in Hayes, Hobbs
and Lees, and the season of 1906, under the captaincy of Lord
Dalmeny, showed a revival, a new fast bowler being found in N. A.
Knox, and a fine batsman and bowler in J. N. Crawford.</p>

<p>Several of the celebrated cricketers of early times already mentioned
as having played for the Surrey club were more closely
associated with the adjoining county of Sussex, whose
records go back as far as 1734, in which year a match was
<span class="sidenote">Sussex.</span>
played against Kent, the chief promoters of which were the duke
of Richmond and Sir William Gage. One of the earliest famous
cricketers, Richard Newland (d. 1791), was a Sussex man; and James
Broadbridge, W. Lambert, Tom Box, and the great Lillywhite
family were all members of the Sussex county team. Lambert, in
a match against Epsom, played at Lord&rsquo;s in 1817, made a &ldquo;century&rdquo;
(one hundred runs) in each innings, a feat not repeated in first-class
cricket for fifty years; and the occasion was the first when the
aggregate of a thousand runs was scored in a match. Broadbridge
played for Sussex in five reigns, while Box (1808-1876) kept wicket
for the county for twenty-four years without missing a match.
Notwithstanding this distinguished history, Sussex never attained
the highest place in the county rivalry, and for a number of years
towards the end of the 19th century the left-handed batting of F. M.
Lucas (1860-1887) alone saved the county from complete insignificance.
A revival came when W. L. Murdoch (b. 1855), of Australian
celebrity, qualified for Sussex; and at a still later date the fortunes
of the county were raised by the inclusion in its eleven of Kumar
Shri Ranjitsinhji, afterwards H.H. the Jam of Nawanagar (b. 1872),
the Indian prince, who had played for Cambridge University.
Ranjitsinhji&rsquo;s dexterity, grace and style were unrivalled. He
scored 2780 runs in 1896, averaging 57, while in county matches in
1899 his aggregate was 2555, with an average of 75. Even this
performance was beaten in 1900 when he scored a total of 2563 runs,
giving an average for the season of 83. In all matches his aggregates
were 3159 in 1899, and 3065 in 1900. Not less remarkable was the
cricket of C. B. Fry (b. 1872), who came from Oxford University to
become a mainstay of Sussex cricket, and who in 1901 performed
the unparalleled feat of scoring in successive innings 106, 209, 149,
105, 140 and 105, his aggregate for the season being 3147 with an
average of 78. In 1905 his average for Sussex was 86, but in the
following year an accident kept him out of the cricket field throughout
the season; and in 1909 he transferred his services to Hampshire.</p>

<p>If Kent and Middlesex may be described as the counties of
amateurs, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire should be called the
counties of famous professionals. Between 1864 and
1889 Nottinghamshire was champion county twelve times
<span class="sidenote">Notts.</span>
and the county eleven was as a rule composed almost entirely of
professional players, among whom have been many of the greatest
names in the history of the game. Richard Daft (1835-1900), after
playing as an amateur, became a professional in preference to
abandoning the game, scorning to resort to any of the pretexts by
which cricketers have been known to accept payment for their
services while continuing to cling to the status of the amateur.
William Oscroft (1843-1905) was one of Nottinghamshire&rsquo;s early
batting heroes, and in Alfred Shaw (b. 1842) and F. Morley (1850-1884)
the county possessed an invaluable pair of bowlers. William
Gunn (b. 1858), besides being a magnificent fielder &ldquo;in the country,&rdquo;
was an exceptionally able batsman; but his performances did not
equal those of his greater contemporary, Arthur Shrewsbury, who in
six years between 1885 and 1892 headed the English batting averages.
Shrewsbury&rsquo;s perfect style combined with inexhaustible patience
placed him in the front rank of the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; batsmen of English
cricket. Of the batsmen nicknamed &ldquo;stonewallers,&rdquo; who at one time
endangered the popularity of first-class cricket, was W. Scotton
(1856-1893); and among the other numerous professionals whose
cricket contributed to the renown of Nottinghamshire were Barnes
(1852-1899), at times a most formidable bat; Flowers (b. 1856),
always useful both with the bat and the ball; W. Attewell (b. 1861),
a remarkably steady bowler who bowled an abnormal number of
maiden overs; Mordecai Sherwin (b. 1851), an excellent successor
to T. Plumb (b. 1833) and F. Wild (1847-1893) as wicket-keeper
for the county; and among more recent players, J. Iremonger (b.
1877) and John Gunn, both of whom proved themselves cricketers
worthy of the Notts traditions. J. A. Dixon (b. 1861), one of the
few amateurs of the Nottinghamshire records, was for some time
captain of the county team; and he was succeeded by A. O. Jones
(b. 1873), a dashing batsman, who in 1899 was partner with Shrewsbury
when the pair scored 391 for the first wicket in a match against
Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>The history of Yorkshire cricket is modern in comparison with
that of Surrey, Sussex or Kent. The county club only dates from
1861, and for some years the team was composed entirely
of professionals. But though Yorkshire attained the
<span class="sidenote">Yorkshire.</span>
championship three times during the first ten years of the county
club&rsquo;s existence, thirteen years elapsed after 1870 before it again
occupied the place of honour. In the ten years 1896-1906 Yorkshire
was no less than six times at the head of the list, this position of
supremacy being in no small measure due to the captaincy of Lord
Hawke (b. 1860), who played continuously for the county from his
university days for more than twenty years, and whose influence on
Yorkshire cricket was unique. But before his time Yorkshire had
already produced some notable cricketers, such as George Ulyett
(1857-1898), who headed the batting averages in 1878, and who
was also a fine fast bowler; Louis Hall (b. 1852), a patient bat;
and another excellent scorer, Ephraim Lockwood (b. 1845). William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
Bates (1855-1900), too, was effective both as batsman and bowler;
and Tom Emmett (1841-1904), long proverbial for bowling &ldquo;a
wide and a wicket,&rdquo; was deservedly popular. To the earlier period
belonged two fast bowlers, George Freeman (1844-1895) and Allan
Hill (b. 1845), and the eminent wicket-keeper Pincher (1841-1903),
who was succeeded by J. Hunter (1857-1891), and later by his
brother Daniel Hunter (b. 1862). The full effect of Lord Hawke&rsquo;s
energetic captaincy was seen in 1900, when Yorkshire played through
a programme of twenty-eight fixtures without sustaining a defeat;
and the county&rsquo;s record was but little inferior in both the following
years and again in 1905, in each of which years it retained the
championship. It was during this period that as notable a group of
cricketers wore the Yorkshire colours as ever appeared in county
matches. Edmund Peate (1856-1900), one of the finest bowlers
in his day, did not survive to take part in the later triumphs of his
county; but the period beginning in 1890 saw J. T. Brown, J. Tunnicliffe,
R. Peel, W. Rhodes, George Hirst and the Hon. F. S. Jackson
in the field. The two first named became famous for their first
wicket partnerships. In 1896 in a match against Middlesex at Lord&rsquo;s
these two batsmen scored 139 before being separated in the first
innings, and in the second knocked off the 147 required to win the
match. In the following year they made 378 for the first wicket
against Surrey, and during their careers they scored over a hundred
for the first wicket on no less than fifteen occasions, the greatest feat
of all being in 1898, when they beat the world&rsquo;s record by staying
together till 554 runs had been compiled. Peel was for many years
an untiring bowler, and Yorkshire was fortunate in discovering a
successor of even superior skill in Wilfrid Rhodes, who in 1900 took
over 200 wickets at a cost of 12 runs each in county matches alone,
and was also an excellent bat. Hirst and Jackson were the two
finest all-round cricketers in England about 1905. The Hon. F. S.
Jackson (b. 1870), like his fellow-Harrovian A. C. MacLaren, had a
wonderful record in test matches against Australia; he captained the
England eleven in 1905, and his wonderful nerve enabled him to
extricate his side when in a difficulty, and to render his best service
at an emergency. Hirst (b. 1871) in 1904 and in 1905 scored over
2000 runs and took more than 100 wickets; and in 1906 he surpassed
all previous records by scoring over 2000 runs and taking over 200
wickets during the season. A concourse of 78,000 people watched
his &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; match (Yorkshire against Lancashire) in August 1904.
Besides cricketers like these, such fine players were included in the
team as Wainwright (b. 1865), Haigh (b. 1871), Denton (b. 1874),
and E. Smith (b. 1869); with such material the Yorkshire eleven
had no &ldquo;tail,&rdquo; and was able to win the championship six times in
a decade.</p>

<p>Somersetshire hardly fulfilled the promise held out by the success
achieved in the closing decade of the 19th century; this had been
largely owing to the captaincy and brilliant batting of
H. T. Hewett (b. 1864), who in partnership with L. C. H.
<span class="sidenote">Somersetshire.</span>
Palairet (b. 1870), famous for his polished style, scored
346 for the first wicket in a match against Yorkshire in 1892. Hewett
was succeeded in the command of the county eleven by the Cambridge
fast bowler, S. M. J. Woods (b. 1868); and among other members
of the eleven the most valuable was L. C. Braund (b. 1876), a professional
who excelled as an all-round cricketer.</p>

<p>The counties above referred to are those which have figured most
prominently in the history of county cricket. Individual players of
the highest excellence are, however, to be found from time
to time in all parts of the country. Warwickshire, for
<span class="sidenote">Minor counties.</span>
example, can boast of having had in A. A. Lilley (b. 1867)
the best wicket-keeper of his day, who represented England
against Australia in the test matches; while Worcestershire produced
one of the best all-round professionals in the country for a
number of years in Arnold (b. 1877), and a batsman of extreme
brilliancy in R. E. Foster, a member of a cricketing family to whom
belongs the credit of raising Worcestershire into a cricketing county
of the first class. Derbyshire, similarly, can claim some well-known
cricket names, the bowler W. Mycroft (1841-1894), W. Chatterton
(b. 1863), and W. Storer (b. 1868), a first-class wicket-keeper. Essex
possesses at Leyton one of the best county grounds in the country,
and the club was helped over financial difficulties by the munificent
support of an old Uppingham and Cambridge cricketer, C. E. Green.
It has produced a fair number of excellent players, notably the batsmen
P. Perrin, C. MacGahey, and the fast bowler C. J. Kortright;
and A. P. Lucas, afterwards a member of the county club, was a
famous cricketer who played for England in 1880 in the first Australian
test match. Hampshire had a fine batsman in Captain E. G. Wynyard,
and its annals are conspicuous for the phenomenal scores made
during the single season of 1899 by Major R. M. Poore; these two
put together 411 against Somersetshire in that year before being
separated. Among the later Hants professionals, Llewellyn was most
prominent.</p>

<p>The distribution of cricketing ability in England might be the
subject of some interesting speculation. In the first forty years
of the annual competition for the championship six counties alone
gained the coveted distinction, and three of these, Surrey, Notts and
Yorkshire, won it thirty-four times between them. Why, it may be
asked, is it that one county excels in the game while another has no
place whatever in the history of cricket? How comes it that great
names recur continually in the annals of Surrey and Yorkshire, for
example, while those of Berkshire and Lincolnshire are entirely
barren? No doubt proximity to great centres of population favours
the cultivation of the game, but in this respect Kent and Sussex are
no better situated than Hertfordshire, nor does it account for Nottinghamshire
having so illustrious a record while Staffordshire has none
at all, nor for Somersetshire having outclassed Devon. It is strange,
moreover, that while the universities are the chief training-grounds
for amateur cricketers, neither Oxfordshire nor Cambridgeshire has
made any mark among the counties. The influence of individuals
and families, such as the Graces in Gloucestershire, the Walkers in
Middlesex, and in recent times the Fosters in Worcestershire, has
of course been of inestimable benefit to cricket in those counties;
but Buckinghamshire and Norfolk and Cheshire send their sons to
the public schools and universities no less than Lancashire or Kent.
It is difficult, therefore, to understand why county cricket should
so persistently confine itself to a small number of counties; but
such is the fact.</p>

<p>Cricket has never flourished vigorously in Scotland, Ireland or
Wales, a fact that may partly be accounted for by the comparative
difficulty of obtaining good grounds in those parts of the kingdom,
and by the inferiority, for the purpose of cricket, of their climate.
In the south of Scotland, and especially in the neighbourhood of
Edinburgh, there are clubs which keep the game alive; and Scotland,
though it has produced no great cricketers, either amateur or professional,
has sent a few players to the English university elevens
who have found places in English county teams. In Ireland cricket
is fairly popular, especially in those parts of the island where local
sides can obtain assistance from soldiers quartered in the neighbourhood.
One or two counties play annual matches, that between
Kildare and Cork in particular exciting keen rivalry. Trinity
College, Dublin, has turned out some excellent players; and the
Phoenix and Leinster clubs in Dublin, and the North of Ireland club
in Belfast, play a full programme of matches every season. D. N.
Trotter, who played for county Meath for many years towards the
close of the 19th century, was a batsman who would have found a
place in any English county eleven; so also would William Hone,
one of several brothers all of whom were keen and skilful cricketers.
About the same period Lieutenant Dunn scored so many centuries
in Irish cricket that he was played, though without any great success,
for his native county of Surrey. More recently L. H. Gwynn (1873-1902)
batted in a style and with a success that proved him capable
of great things. Sir T. C. O&rsquo;Brien, though an Irishman, belongs as a
cricketer to Middlesex; but T. C. Ross, who was chosen to play for
Gentlemen v. Players at Lord&rsquo;s in 1902, was a bowler who played
regularly for county Kildare.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen v. Players.</i>&mdash;The most important match of the year as
far as purely English cricket is concerned is the match between the
gentlemen and players (amateurs and professionals) played at Lord&rsquo;s.
For many years a match played between sides similarly composed
at the Oval excited equal interest, but latterly county cricket has
rather starved this particular game, though it still continues as a
popular fixture. Other matches with the same title have been played
in London on Prince&rsquo;s Ground (now built over), and at Brighton,
Hastings and Scarborough and elsewhere, but those games in no
way rank with the London matches.</p>

<p>The Lord&rsquo;s fixture was first established in 1806, in which year two
matches were played; it became annual in 1819, but in those days
the amateurs, being no match for their opponents, generally received
odds, while in 1832 they defended wickets 22 in. by 6, and in 1837
the professionals stood in front of wickets of four stumps, measuring
in all 36 in. by 12 in. This match was known as &ldquo;The Barndoor
Match&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ward&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; and the professionals won by an innings
and 10 runs. Odds were not given after 1838, the gentlemen having
then won eight matches and lost thirteen. From 1839 to 1866 the
gentlemen only won 7 matches as compared with 21 losses. In 1867
the tide turned, for the brothers Grace, especially Dr W. G. Grace,
became a power in the cricket-field, and from 1867 to 1884 the
gentlemen, winning fifteen matches, only lost one. From 1885 the
balance swung round, and by 1903 the professionals had won eleven
matches and lost but four. The gentlemen won on nine successive
occasions between 1874 and 1884, a draw intervening; while beginning
with 1854 the professionals won eleven matches &ldquo;off the reel.&rdquo;
The professionals won in 1860 by an innings and no less than 181
runs; in 1900 they only won by two wickets, but to do so had to
make, and did make, 501 runs in the last innings of the match. In
1903 the gentlemen, heavily in arrears after each side had played an
innings, actually scored 500 in their second innings with only two
men out. In 1904 the gentlemen won by two wickets after being
156 runs behind on the first innings, thanks to fine play by K. S.
Ranjitsinhji and A. O. Jones. J. H. King had scored a century in
each innings, a feat previously only performed by R. E. Foster in
1900. C. B. Fry&rsquo;s 232 not out in 1903 was the largest innings scored
in the match. Dr W. G. Grace, who is credited with eight centuries,
is the only cricketer who exceeded the hundred more than twice at
Lord&rsquo;s in the fixture, 164 by J. T. Brown being the highest innings
by a professional. There were seven instances before 1864 of two
bowlers being unchanged in the match, and the Hon. F. S. Jackson
and S. M. J. Woods repeated this in 1894. The Oval match was first
played in 1857. The amateurs effected their first win in 1866, and
though several games were drawn the professionals did not win again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span>
till 1880. As at Lord&rsquo;s, it was the era of Grace, but from this point
the amateurs could only win two matches, and by the narrowest of
margins, till 1903, this making their sum of victories up to then
thirteen, as opposed to twenty-three. In 1879 the gentlemen won
in one innings by 126 runs, the heaviest beating that one side had
inflicted on the other. The highest individual score was Robert
Abel&rsquo;s 247, and the next Dr W. G. Grace&rsquo;s 215. Hayward scored
203 in 1904; A. G. Steel and A. H. Evans bowled unchanged in
1879.</p>

<p><i>School and Club Cricket.</i>&mdash;Cricket is the standing summer game
at every English private and public school, where it is taught as
carefully and systematically as either classics or mathematics. There
are also numbers of amateur clubs which possess no grounds of their
own and are connected with no particular locality, but which are in
fact mere associations of cricketers who play matches against the
universities, schools or local teams, or against each other. Of these
the best known, perhaps, is I Zingari (The Wanderers), popularly
known as I.Z., whose well-known colours, red, yellow and black
stripes, are prized rather as a social than as a cricketing distinction.
This club was founded in 1845 by Lorraine Baldwin and Sir Spencer
Ponsonby-Fane. The first rule of the club humorously declares that
&ldquo;the entrance fee shall be nothing, and the annual subscription
shall not exceed the entrance fee.&rdquo; It is a rule of the club that no
member shall play on the opposing side. I.Z. has long been connected
with the social festivities forming a feature of the &ldquo;Canterbury
Week,&rdquo; a cricket festival held at Canterbury during the first
week in August, of the Scarborough week, and of the Dublin horse-show.
Dr W. G. Grace, who almost invariably appeared in the
cricket field wearing the red and yellow stripes of the M.C.C., and
some other notable amateurs, never belonged to I.Z. or any similar
club; but Dr Grace was instrumental in the formation of the London
county club, whose ground was at the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.
Other amateur clubs, similar to I Zingari, are the Free Foresters,
Incogniti, Etceteras, and in Ireland Na Shuler; while the Eton
Ramblers, Harrow Wanderers, Old Wykehamists, and others are
clubs whose membership is restricted to &ldquo;old boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Oxford and Cambridge universities match was first played in
1827, but was not an annual fixture till 1838. Five matches, those
of 1829, 1843, 1846, 1848 and 1850, were played at Oxford, the rest
at Lord&rsquo;s. The &ldquo;&rsquo;Varsity match,&rdquo; and that between the two great
public schools, Eton and Harrow, are great &ldquo;society&rdquo; events at
Lord&rsquo;s every summer. Up to 1909 Eton won thirty times, and
Harrow on thirty-five occasions. D. C. Boles by scoring 183 in
1904 set up a new record for this match, beating the 152 obtained
in 1841 by Emilius Bayley (afterwards the Rev. Sir John Robert
Laurie); and in 1907 the Harrow captain, M. C. Bird, established a
further record by scoring over a hundred runs in each innings. Of
the contests between Oxford and Cambridge, the latter (up to 1909)
had lost thirty-one and won thirty-five. Oxford&rsquo;s 503 in 1900 and
Cambridge&rsquo;s 392 in the same match furnished the highest aggregates.
The largest individual innings was 172 not out by J. F. Marsh in
1904; but as a feat of batting it was intrinsically inferior to the 171
by R. E. Foster in 1900. Of the thirty centuries scored up to 1909,
Oxford was credited with sixteen. Eustace Crawley (b. 1868) made
a hundred both in the Eton v. Harrow and Oxford v. Cambridge
matches. In the match of 1870 F. C. Cobden (b. 1849) took the last
three Oxford wickets with consecutive balls, winning the match for
Cambridge by 2 runs.</p>

<p><i>Australian Cricket.</i>&mdash;Naturally popular in a British colony,
cricket made but little progress in Australia before the arrival of an
English professional eleven in 1861-1862, which carried all before it.
Subsequent visits, and the coaching of imported professionals, so
promoted the game that in 1878 a representative eleven of Australians
visited England. The visits were repeated biennially till
1890, and then triennially. The visits of the Australian teams to
England aroused unparalleled interest and acted as an immense
incentive to the game. A great sensation was caused when the first
team, captained by D. W. Gregory, on the 27th of May 1878, defeated
a powerful M.C.C. eleven in a single day, disposing of them for 33
and 19, the fast bowler F. R. Spofforth (b. 1853) taking 6 wickets
for 4 runs, and H. F. Boyle (b. 1847) 5 for 3. Their prowess was well
maintained when in September 1880 Australia for the first time met
the whole strength of England, such matches between representatives
of Australia and England being known as &ldquo;test matches,&rdquo; a term
that was applied later to matches between England and South
Africans also. Although in 1880 the old country won by 5 wickets,
the honours were fairly divided, especially as Spofforth could not
play. Dr W. G. Grace with a score of 152 headed the total of 420,
but even finer was the Australian captain W. L. Murdoch&rsquo;s imperturbable
display, when he carried his bat for 153. From 1882 onwards
the Colonials, with two exceptions, at Blackpool and Skegness, only
played eleven-a-side matches. Such bowlers as Spofforth, Boyle,
G. E. Palmer (b. 1861), T. W. Garrett (b. 1858), and G. Giffen (1859)
became household names. Nor was the batting less admirable,
for Murdoch was supported by H. H. Massie (b. 1854), P. S.
McDonnell (1860-1896), A. C. Bannerman (b. 1859), T. Horan
(b. 1855), C. J. Bonnor (b. 1855), and S. P. Jones (b. 1861), whilst
the wicket-keeper was McCarthy Blackham (b. 1855). This visiting
side in 1882 was the greatest team of all; 23 matches were won,
only 4 lost, and England was defeated at the Oval by 7 runs. In
1884 English cricket had improved, and the visiting record was
hardly so good. The match against England at the Oval will not
soon be forgotten. The Colonials scored 551 (Murdoch 211, McDonnell
103, Scott 102), and England responded with 346, Scotton and
W. W. Read adding 151 for the ninth wicket.</p>

<p>The team of H. J. H. Scott (b. 1858) in 1886 proved less successful,
for all three test matches were lost, and eight defeats had to be set
against nine victories, but Giffen covered himself with distinction.
This was the first tour under the auspices of the Melbourne Club.
McDonnell&rsquo;s team in 1888 marked the appearance of the bowlers
C. T. B. Turner (b. 1862) and J. J. Ferris (1867-1900). The former
took 314 wickets for 11 runs each, and the latter 220 for 14 apiece.
To all appearance they redeemed a poor tour, 19 matches being
won and 14 lost. The 1890 tour, though Murdoch reappeared as
captain, proved disappointing, both the test matches being lost and
defeats for the first time exceeding victories, though the two bowlers
again performed marvellously well. After an interval of three years,
M. Blackham captained the seventh team, which was moderately
fortunate. H. Graham (b. 1870) and S. E. Gregory (b. 1870) batted
admirably, and the 149 of J. J. Lyons (b. 1863) in the match against
M.C.C. was an extraordinary display of punishing cricket. In
1896, though they did not win the rubber of test matches, the
colonials were most successful, 19 matches being victories and only
6 lost. S. E. Gregory, J. Darling (b. 1870), F. A. Iredale (b. 1867),
G. Giffen, C. Hill (b. 1877), and G. H. S. Trott (1866-1905) were
the best bats, and the last-named made an admirable captain.
H. Trumble (1867) kept an excellent length, and E. Jones (1869) was
deadly with his fast bowling.</p>

<p>The Australian representatives in 1899 demonstrated that they
were the best since 1882, 16 successes and only 3 defeats (v. Essex,
Surrey and Kent) being emphasized by a victory over England at
Lord&rsquo;s by 10 wickets, the only one of the five test matches brought to
a conclusion. M. A. Noble (b. 1873) and Victor Trumper (b. 1877), both
newcomers, batted superbly. The latter, v. Sussex, made 300, the
largest individual score hitherto made by an Australian in England,
the previous best having been 286 by Murdoch in the corresponding
match in 1882. H. Trumble scored 1183 runs and took 142 wickets
for 18 runs apiece, and Darling not only made a judicious captain,
but scored the biggest aggregate, 1941, up to then obtained by any
batsman touring with a colonial eleven in England. On the home side,
Hayward did sound service with the bat, and his stand with F. S.
Jackson in the fifth test match yielded 185 runs for the first wicket.</p>

<p>In 1902 another fine Australian eleven, captained by Darling,
won 23 and lost only 2 matches. They won the rubber of test
matches at Manchester by 3 runs, but lost the final at the Oval by
one wicket after an even more remarkable struggle, G. L. Jessop
having scored 104 in an hour and a quarter. The other defeat
was by Yorkshire by 5 wickets, when they were dismissed for 23
by Hirst and Jackson. The rest of the tour was characterized
by brilliant batting. The performance of Trumper in making 2570
runs (with an average of 48) surpassed anything previously seen;
R. A. Duff (b. 1878) also proved a brilliant run-getter. W. W.
Armstrong (b. 1879) was useful in all departments, and J. V. Saunders
(b. 1876) proved a successful left-handed bowler.</p>

<p>In 1905 there was a marked falling-off, as England won two and
drew the other three test matches; but only one other defeat, by
Essex by 19 runs, had to be set against 16 Australian victories. The
persistent bowling off the wicket by Armstrong, and the inability
to finish games within three days, were the chief drawbacks. Armstrong
eclipsed all previous colonial records in England by heading
both tables of averages, scoring 2002 (average 48) and taking 130
wickets at a cost of 17 runs each. He also compiled the largest
individual score (303 not out v. Somerset) ever made on an Australian
tour. M. A. Noble also exceeded 2000 runs. For a long time the
fast bowler, A. Cotter (b. 1882, N.S.W.), failed, but eventually
&ldquo;came off,&rdquo; just as F. Laver (b. 1869), who had taken many wickets
in the earlier part of the tour, was becoming less formidable. Duff
saved the colonials by a great innings in the fifth test match;
Trumper was less certain than formerly, and Clement Hill more
reckless; whilst J. J. Kelly (b. 1867) on his fifth tour was better
than ever before with the gloves.</p>

<p>The Australians who visited England under the leadership of
M. A. Noble in 1909 were generally held to be a weaker team than
most of their predecessors, but they greatly improved as the season
advanced, proving that the side included several cricketers of the
highest merit, and as a captain Noble has seldom been surpassed in
consummate generalship. Their record of thirteen wins to four
defeats offered little evidence of inferiority, while the large number
of twenty-one drawn matches was accounted for by the cold wet
weather that largely prevailed throughout the summer. Two out of
the five test matches were unfinished, and Australia won the rubber
by two matches to one. In all the test matches England was under
the command of A. C. MacLaren, but the great Harrovian was no
longer the batsman he had been some years earlier; Jackson had
abandoned first-class cricket; Hirst and Hayward were becoming
veterans; and, speaking generally, the English batting was decidedly
inferior, and it collapsed feebly in three of the test matches.
England&rsquo;s failure, for which poor fielding and missed catches were
also responsible, was the more disappointing since they began well
by winning the first test match at Birmingham by ten wickets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
C. B. Fry and Hobbs knocking off the 105 runs required to win in the
second innings without the loss of a wicket. In the third test match,
at Leeds, England was deprived of the services of Hayward and
Blythe through illness, and an accident to Jessop during the match
compelled the side to play a man short. It was in bowling that the
Australians were thought to be least strong; but Laver&rsquo;s analysis
in the Manchester test match, when he took 8 wickets for 31 runs in
England&rsquo;s first innings, was the most notable feature of the match;
and although his record at the head of the bowling averages for the
tour, 70 wickets at an average cost of 14.9 runs, had frequently been
beaten in earlier Australian tours in England, it proved him a worthy
successor of Spofforth, Boyle and Turner. Armstrong, although he
did not equal his record of 1905, again scored over 1000 runs and took
over 100 wickets, his exact figures being 1439 runs and 120 wickets.
The most remarkable Australian batting was that of two young
left-handed players who on this occasion visited England for the
first time, W. Bardsley (b. 1884) and Vernon Ransford (b. 1885), the
latter of whom headed the averages both for test matches (58.8)
and for the whole tour (45.5), his principal achievement being an
innings of 143 not out in the test match at Lord&rsquo;s. Bardsley, who
was second in the test matches averages (39.6), fell into the third
place slightly below Armstrong in the averages for the tour; but he
alone scored over 200 in an innings, which he accomplished twice,
and over 2000 in aggregate for the tour, and he established a test
match &ldquo;record&rdquo; by scoring 136 and 130 in the match at the Oval.
Of the twenty-two &ldquo;centuries&rdquo; scored by Australians during the
season Bardsley and Ransford each made six. Trumper and Noble
each scored over a thousand runs, and Macartney was an invaluable
member of the side both in batting and bowling. As a wicket-keeper
Carter worthily filled the place of Kelly, and the fielding of
the Colonials fully maintained the brilliant Australian standard of
former years.</p>

<p>The following &ldquo;records&rdquo; of Australian cricket in England up to
1909 are of interest:&mdash;Highest total by an Australian team: 843
v. Past and Present of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in 1893.
Highest total against an Australian team: 576 by England at the
Oval in 1899. Lowest total by an Australian team: 18 v. M.C.C. in
1896. Lowest total against an Australian team: 17 by Gloucestershire
in 1896. Highest individual Australian score in one innings:
303 not out by W. W. Armstrong v. Somersetshire in 1905. Highest
individual Australian aggregate in a tour: 2570 by V. T. Trumper in
1902. Two centuries in a match: V. T. Trumper 109 and 119 v.
Essex in 1902; W. Bardsley 136 and 130 v. England in 1909 (test
match record).</p>

<p>The first English team to visit Australia was organized in 1862,
and was captained by H. H. Stephenson. George Parr (1826-1891)
took out the next in 1864, Dr E. M. Grace being the only amateur.
In 1873 the Melbourne Club invited Dr W. G. Grace to take out an
eleven, and three years later James Lillywhite conducted a team of
professionals. On this tour for the first time colonials contended on
equal terms, one match v. Australia being won by 4 wickets and the
other lost by 45 runs. Lord Harris in the autumn of 1878 took a
team of amateurs assisted by Ulyett and Emmett, winning 2 and
losing 3 eleven-a-side encounters, Emmett&rsquo;s 137 wickets averaging
8 runs each. Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite jointly organized
the expedition of 1881, when Australia won the second test match
by 5 wickets. The Hon. Ivo Bligh (afterwards Lord Darnley) in
1882 took a fine team, which was crippled owing to an injury sustained
by the bowler F. Morley. Four victories could be set against
three defeats; Australia winning the only test match, owing to the
batting of Blackham. Shaw&rsquo;s second tour in 1884 showed Barnes
heading both batting and bowling averages, while six victories
counterbalanced two defeats. In the third tour Shrewsbury became
captain, but the English for the first time encountered the bowling
of C. T. B. Turner, who took 27 wickets for 113 runs in two matches.
Australia was twice defeated, the English captain batting in fine
form. On this tour was played the Smokers v. Non-Smokers, when
the latter scored 803 for 9 wickets (Shrewsbury 236, W. Bruce 131,
Gunn 150), against the bowling of Briggs, Boyle, Lohmann, Palmer
and Flowers. The winter of 1887 saw two English teams in Australia,
one under Lord Hawke and G. F. Vernon, the other under Shrewsbury
and Lillywhite. Both teams played well, the batting being
headed by W. W. Read with an average of 65, and Shrewsbury with
58. The ill-success of Lord Sheffield&rsquo;s team in two out of three test
matches did not disprove the great merits of his eleven. Dr W. G.
Grace headed the averages with 44, and received the best support
from Abel and A. E. Stoddart, whilst Attewell, Briggs and Lohmann
all possessed fine bowling figures. A. E. Stoddart&rsquo;s first team (in
1894) achieved immense success and was the best of all. In the first
test match they went in against 586 runs and ultimately won by
10 runs, Ward making 75 and 117. Stoddart himself averaged 51,
scoring 173 in the second test match, and A. C. MacLaren (who
made 228 v. Victoria), Brown and Ward all averaged over 40. The
last tour conducted by Stoddart proved less satisfactory, four of
the five test matches being lost, and some friction being caused by
various incidents. K. S. Ranjitsinhji, who averaged 60 and made
175 in a test match and 189 v. South Australia, and A. C. MacLaren,
who scored five hundreds and averaged 54, were prominent, Hayward
also doing good work; but the bowling broke down. Weakness
in bowling was the cause of the ill success of A. C. MacLaren&rsquo;s
side in 1901. After a brilliant victory by an innings and 124 runs
at Sydney, the other four test matches were all lost. MacLaren
himself batted magnificently, and so did Hayward and Tyldesley.
Braund stood alone as an all-round man. The M.C.C. in 1903
officially despatched a powerful side led by P. F. Warner, and in
every sense except the financial the success was complete. Three
test matches were won and two lost, while two new records were
set up, one by Rhodes obtaining 15 wickets at Melbourne, the other
by R. E. Foster, who in seven hours of brilliant batting compiled
287. Tyldesley and Hayward both did good work as batsmen;
Rhodes and Braund both bowled consistently. The catch-phrase
about &ldquo;bringing back the ashes&rdquo; became almost proverbial; its
origin is to be found in the <i>Sporting Times</i> in 1882 after Australia
had defeated England at the Oval.</p>

<p><i>New Zealand.</i>&mdash;Although cricket has not attained a degree of
perfection in New Zealand commensurate with that in Australia, it
is keenly played. Lord Hawke sent out from England a team in
1902-1903 which won all the eighteen matches arranged.</p>

<p><i>Cricket in India.</i>&mdash;Not only the English who live in India, but
the natives also&mdash;Parsees, Hindus and Mahommedans alike&mdash;play
cricket. A Parsee eleven visited England in 1884 and 1888.</p>

<p><i>South Africa.</i>&mdash;South African cricketers visiting England are
handicapped by playing on turf instead of on the matting wickets
used in South Africa. The side which came over during the Boer
War in 1901 won 13, lost 9, and drew 2 matches, playing a tie with
Worcestershire, and showing marked improvement on the team which
had visited England in 1894. E. A. Halliwell (b. 1864) proved a
fine wicket-keeper, J. H. Sinclair (b. 1876) a good all-round cricketer,
J. J. Kotze (b. 1879) a very fast bowler, and G. A. Rowe (b. 1872)
clever with the ball. In 1904 more decided success was achieved,
for on a more ambitious programme ten victories could be set against
two defeats by Worcestershire and Kent, with a tie with Middlesex.
The most important success was a victory by 189 runs over a
powerful England eleven at Lord&rsquo;s, when R. O. Schwarz (b. 1875)
scored 102 and 26, and took 8 wickets for 106, dismissing Ranjitsinhji
twice. Kotze and Sinclair again bore the brunt of the attack.
Of the English teams visiting South Africa, that taken by Lord
Hawke in 1894 did not meet with such important opposition as the
one he led in 1900, yet the side came back undefeated, having won
all three test matches. P. F. Warner and F. Mitchell, with Tyldesley,
were the chief run-getters, Haigh, Trott and Cuttell bowling finely.
In the winter of 1905 the M.C.C. sent out a side under P. F. Warner,
but it lost four out of the five test matches, F. L. Fane and J. N.
Crawford being the most successful of the Englishmen, and G. C. White
(1882) and A. D. Nourse proving themselves great colonial batsmen.
In 1907 a representative South African team came to England, and
their improved status in the cricketing world was shown by the
arrangement of test matches. In the winter of 1909-1910 an English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
team under Mr Leveson Gower went to South Africa, and played
test matches.</p>

<p><i>West Indies.</i>&mdash;West Indian cricketers toured in England in 1900,
winning 5 matches and losing 8. The best batsman was C. A.
Olivierre (b. 1876), who subsequently qualified for Derbyshire. The
brunt of the bowling devolved on S. Woods and T. Burton (b. 1878).
In 1897 teams under Lord Hawke and A. Priestly (b. 1865) both
visited West Indies, Trinidad defeating both powerful combinations.
R. S. Lucas (b. 1867) had in 1895 taken out a successful side. A
much weaker combination in 1902 suffered five defeats but won
13 matches. B. J. T. Bosanquet, E. R. Wilson (b. 1879) and E. M.
Dowson (b. 1880) were the chief performers. In 1906 another West
Indian side visited England, but were not particularly successful.</p>

<p><i>America.</i>&mdash;In the United States cricket has always had to contend
with the popularity of baseball, and in Canada with the rival attractions
of lacrosse. Nevertheless it has grown in popularity,
Philadelphia being the headquarters of the game in the New World.</p>

<p>The Germantown, Belmont, Merion and Philadelphia Clubs play
annually for the Halifax Cup, and the game is controlled by the
Associated Cricket clubs of Philadelphia. In the neighbourhood
of New York matches are arranged by the Metropolitan District
Cricket League and the New York Cricket Association; similar
organizations are the Northwestern, the California and the Massachusetts
associations, while the Intercollegiate Cricket League
consists of college teams representing Harvard, Pennsylvania and
Haverford. R. S. Newhall (b. 1852) and D. S. Newhall (b. 1849)
may almost claim to be the fathers of cricket in the United States;
while D. W. Saunders (b. 1862) did much for the game in Canada.
Other eminent names in American cricket are A. M. Wood; H.
Livingston, of the Pittsburg Club, who scored three centuries in
one week in 1907; H. V. Hordern, University of Pennsylvania, a
very successful bowler; J. B. King, who in 1906 made 344 not out
for Belmont v. Merion, and who as a fast bowler proved most effective
during two tours in England. At San Francisco in 1894 W.
Robertson and A. G. Sheath compiled a total of 340 without the loss
of a wicket, the former scoring 206 not out, and the latter 118 not out.
A large number of English cricket teams have visited the United
States and Canada. The first county to do so was Kent in 1904, in
which year the Philadelphians also made a tour in England, in the
course of which J. B. King (b. 1873) took 93 wickets at an average
cost of 14 runs, and proved himself the best all-round man on the
side. P. H. Clark (b. 1873), a clever fast bowler, and J. A. Lester
(b. 1872), the captain of the team, also showed themselves to be
cricketers of merit, while N. Z. Graves (b. 1880) and F. H. Bohlen
(b. 1868) were quite up to English county form. The team did not,
however, include G. S. Patterson (b. 1868), one of the best batsmen
in America. The Philadelphians again visited Great Britain in 1908,
when they won 7 out of 14 matches, one being drawn. On this tour
King surpassed his former English record by taking 115 wickets, and
Wood, who played one fine innings of 132, was the most successful
of the American batsmen.</p>

<p><i>Other Countries.</i>&mdash;The English residents of Portugal support
the game, but were no match for a moderate English team that
visited them in 1898. In Holland, chiefly at the Hague and Haarlem,
cricket is played to a limited extent on matting wickets. Dutch
elevens have visited England, and English elevens have crossed to
Holland, the most important visit being that of the gentlemen of
the M.C.C. in 1902, the Englishmen winning all the matches.</p>

<p><i>Professionalism.</i>&mdash;The remuneration of the first-class English
professionals is £6 per match, out of which expenses have to be paid;
a man engaged on a ground to bowl receives from £2, 10s. to £3, 10s.
a week when not away playing matches. A professional player
generally receives extra reward for good batting or bowling, the
amount being sometimes a fixed sum of £1 for every fifty runs, more
frequently a sum awarded by the committee on the recommendation
of the captain. Some counties give their men winter pay, others try
to provide them with suitable work when cricket is over. A few get
cricket in other countries during the English winter. For international
matches professional players and &ldquo;reserves&rdquo; receive
£20 each, though before 1896 the fee was only £10; players (and
reserves) in Gentlemen v. Players at Lord&rsquo;s are paid £10. A good
county professional generally receives a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; after about ten
years&rsquo; service; but the amount of the proceeds varies capriciously
with the weather, the duration of the match, and the attendance.
In the populous northern counties of England benefits are far more
lucrative than in the south, but £800 to £1000 may be regarded
as a good average result. County clubs generally exercise some
control over the sums received. Umpires are paid £6 a match; in
minor games they receive about £1 a day.</p>

<p><i>Records.</i>&mdash;Records other than those already cited may be added for
reference. A schoolboy named A. E. J. Collins, at Clifton College in
1899, excited some interest by scoring 628 not out in a boy&rsquo;s match,
being about seven hours at the wicket. C. J. Eady (b. 1870) scored 566
for Break o&rsquo; Day v. Wellington in eight hours in 1902, the total being
911. A. E. Stoddart made 485 for Hampstead v. Stoics in 1886.
In first-class cricket the highest individual score for a batsman is
A. C. MacLaren&rsquo;s 424 for Lancashire v. Somerset at Taunton in
1895. Melbourne University scored 1094 against Essendon in March
1898, this being the highest authenticated total on record. M.C.C.
and Ground made 735 v. Wiltshire in 1888, the highest total at Lord&rsquo;s.
In the match between A. E. Stoddart&rsquo;s team and New South Wales
at Sydney in 1898, 1739 runs were scored, an aggregate unparalleled
in first-class cricket. The highest total for an innings in a first-class
match is 918 for N.S.W. v. South Australia in January 1901. Yorkshire
scored 887 v. Warwickshire at Birmingham in May 1896. The
lowest total in a first-class match is 12 by Northamptonshire v.
Gloucestershire in June 1907. The record for first wicket is 472 by
S. Colman and P. Coles at Eastbourne in 1892. The longest partnership
on record is 623 by Captain Oates and Fitzgerald at the Curragh
in 1895. The best stand that has been made for the last wicket in
a first-class match is 230 runs, which was run up by R. W. Nicholls
and Roche playing for Middlesex v. Kent at Lord&rsquo;s in 1899.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;averages&rdquo; of individual players for batting and bowling
annually excite a good deal of interest, and there is a danger that
some players may think too much of their averages and too little of
the sporting side of the game. Any comparison of the highest averages
during a series of years would be misleading, owing to improvements
in grounds, difference of weather, and the variations in the number
of innings.</p>

<p>The following table of aggregates, compiled from the figures to
the end of 1905, affords a summary of the records of a select list of
historic cricketers; it will serve to supplement some details already
given above about them and others.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRICKHOWELL,<a name="ar263" id="ar263"></a></span> a market town of Brecknockshire, Wales,
14 m. E. of Brecon, beautifully situated on the left bank of the
Usk, which divides it from Llangattock. Pop. (1901) 1150. The
nearest railway stations are Govilon (5 m.) and Gilwern (4 m.)
on the London &amp; North-Western railway, but a mail and
passenger motor service running between Abergavenny and
Brecon passes through the town. It is also served by the
Brecon &amp; Newport Canal, which passes through Llangattock
about a mile distant. Agriculture is almost the sole industry
of the district. The town derives its name from a British fortress,
Crûg Hywel, commonly called Table Mountain, about 2 m.
N.N.E. of the town. Crickhowell Castle, of which only a tower
remains, probably dated from the Norman conquest of the
country. The manor of Crickhowell used to be regarded as a
borough by prescription, but there is no record of its ever having
possessed any municipal institutions. The church is in transitional
Decorated style.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRICKLADE,<a name="ar264" id="ar264"></a></span> a market town in the Cricklade parliamentary
division of Wiltshire, England, 9 m. N.W. of Swindon, on the
Midland &amp; South-Western Junction railway. Pop. (1901)
1517. It is pleasantly situated in the plain which borders the
south bank of the Thames, not far from the Thames &amp; Severn
Canal. The cruciform church of St Sampson is mainly Perpendicular,
with a fine ornate tower, and an old rood-stone in
its churchyard. The small church of St Mary has an Early
English tower, Perpendicular aisles and a Norman chancel-arch.
There is some agricultural trade.</p>

<p>Legend makes Cricklade the abode of a school of Greek
philosophers before the Roman conquest, and the name is given
as &ldquo;Greeklade&rdquo; in Drayton&rsquo;s <i>Polyolbion</i>. It owed its importance
in Saxon times to its position at the passage of the Thames.
During the revolt of Æthelwald the Ætheling in 905 he and
his army &ldquo;harried all the Mercian&rsquo;s land until they came to
Cricklade and there they went over the Thames&rdquo; (Anglo-Sax.
Chron. <i>sub anno</i>), and in 1016 Canute came with his army over
the Thames into Mercia at Cricklade (ibid.). There was a mint at
Cricklade in the time of Edward the Confessor and William I.,
and William of Dover fortified a castle here in the reign of
Stephen. In the reign of Henry III. a hospital dedicated to
St John the Baptist was founded at Cricklade, and placed under
the government of a warden or prior. Cricklade was a borough
by prescription at least as early as the Domesday Survey, and
returned two members to parliament from 1295 until disfranchised
by the Redistribution Act of 1885. The borough
was never incorporated, but certain liberties, including exemption
from toll and passage, were granted to the townsmen by Henry
III. and confirmed by successive sovereigns. In 1257 Baldwin
de Insula obtained a grant of a Thursday market, and an annual
three days&rsquo; fair at the feast of St Peter ad Vincula. The market
was subsequently changed to Saturday, and was much frequented
by dealers in corn and cattle, but is now inconsiderable. During
the 14th century Cricklade formed part of the dowry of the
queens of England. In the reign of Henry VI. the lordship was
acquired by the Hungerford family, and in 1427 Sir Walter
Hungerford granted the reversion of the manor to the dean and
chapter of Salisbury cathedral to aid towards the repair of their
belfry.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIEFF,<a name="ar265" id="ar265"></a></span> a police burgh of Perthshire, Scotland, capital of
Strathearn, 17¾ m. W. of Perth by the Caledonian railway.
Pop. (1901) 5208. Occupying the southern slopes of a hill on
the left bank of the Earn, here crossed by a bridge, it practically
consists of a main street, with narrower streets branching off
at right angles. Its climate is the healthiest in mid-Scotland,
the air being pure and dry. Its charter is said to date from 1218,
and it was the seat of the courts of the earls of Strathearn till
1747, when heritable jurisdictions were abolished. A Runic
sculptured stone, believed to be of the 8th century, and the old
town cross stand in High Street, but the great cattle fair, for
which Crieff was once famous, was removed to Falkirk in 1770.
It was probably in connexion with this market that the &ldquo;kind
gallows of Crieff&rdquo; acquired their notoriety, for they were mostly
used for the execution of Highland cattle-stealers. The principal
buildings are the town hall, tolbooth, public library, assembly
rooms, mechanics&rsquo; institute, Morison&rsquo;s academy (founded in
1859), and Strathearn House, a hydropathic establishment
built on an eminence at the back of the town, and itself sheltered
by the Knock of Crieff (911 ft. high). The industries consist
of manufactures of cotton, linen, woollens and worsteds, and
leather. Drummond Castle, about 3 m. S., is celebrated for
its gardens. They cover an area of 10 acres, are laid out in
terraces, and illustrate Italian, Dutch and French styles. They
were planned by the 2nd earl of Perth (d. 1662), and take rank
with the most magnificent in the United Kingdom. The keep
of the castle dates from 1490, and much of the original building
was demolished in 1689, a few years after its siege by Cromwell.
The present structure was erected subsequent to the extinction
of the Jacobite rebellion.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIME<a name="ar266" id="ar266"></a></span> (Lat. <i>crimen</i>, accusation), the general term for offences
against the <span class="sc">Criminal Law</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). Crime has been defined as
&ldquo;a failure or refusal to live up to the standard of conduct
deemed binding by the rest of the community.&rdquo; Sir James
Stephen describes it as &ldquo;some act or omission in respect of
which legal punishment may be inflicted on the person who is
in default whether by acting or omitting to act.&rdquo; Such action
or neglect of action may be injurious or hurtful to society. It
is a wrong or tort, to be prevented and corrected by the strong
arm of the law.</p>

<p>Crimes vary in character with times and countries. Under
different circumstances of place and custom, that which at one
time is denounced as a crime, at another passes as a meritorious
act. It was once an imperative duty for the family to avenge
the death of a kinsman, and the blood feud had a sanction that
made killing no murder. Again, among primitive tribes to make
away with parents at an advanced age or suffering from an
incurable disease was a filial duty. Polyandry was sometimes
encouraged, and cannibalism practised with general approval;
religious sentiment elevated into heinous crimes, blasphemy,
heresy, sacrilege, sorcery and even science when it ran counter
to accepted dogmas of the church. Offences multiplied when
people gathered into communities and the rights of property
and of personal security were understood and established. The
law of the strongest might still interfere with individual ownership;
the weakest went to the wall; authority, whether exercised
by one master or by the combined government of the many,
was resisted, and this resistance constituted crime. As civilization
spread and the bulk of the population settled into orderliness,
society, for its own comfort, convenience and protection, would
not tolerate the infraction of its rules, and rising against all law-breakers
decreed reprisals against them as the common enemy.
Then began that constant warfare between criminals and the
forces of law and order which has been continuously waged
through the centuries with varying degrees of bitterness.</p>

<p>The combat with crime was long waged with great cruelty.
Extreme penalties were thought to constitute the best deterrent,
and the principle of vengeance chiefly inspired the penal law.
The harshness of ancient codes makes a more humane age
shudder. It was the custom to hang or decapitate, or otherwise
take life in some more or less barbarous fashion, on the smallest
excuse. The final act was preceded by hideous torture. It was
performed with the utmost barbarity. Victims were put to
death by breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake, by dismemberment
and flaying or boiling alive. These were the
aggravations of the original idea of riddance, of checking crime
by the absolute removal of the offender. Only slowly and
gradually milder methods came into force. Revenge and
retaliation were no longer the chief aims, the law had a larger
mission than to coerce the criminal and force him by severity
to mend his ways. To withdraw him for a lengthened period
from the sphere of his baneful activity was something; to subject
him to more or less irksome processes, to solitary confinement
upon short diet, deprived of all the solaces of life, with severe
labour, were sharp lessons limited in effect to those actually
subjected to them, but too remote to deter the outside crowd
of potential wrongdoers. The higher duty of the administrator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
is to utilize the period of detention by labouring to reform the
criminal subjects and send them out from gaol reformed
characters. If no very remarkable success has been achieved
in this direction, it is obviously the right aim, and it is being more
and more steadfastly pursued. But it is generally accepted in
principle that to eradicate criminal proclivities and cut off
recruits from the permanent army of crime the work must be
undertaken when the subject is of an age susceptible of
reform; hence the extreme value attaching to the more
enlightened treatment of crime in embryo, a principle becoming
more and more largely accepted in practice among civilized
nations.</p>

<p>It may safely be asserted that the germ of crime is universally
present in mankind, ever ready to show under conditions favourable
to its growth. Children show criminal tendencies in their
earliest years. They exhibit evil traits, anger, resentment,
mendacity; they are often intensely selfish, are strongly acquisitive,
greedy of gain, ready to steal and secrete things at the first
opportunity. Happily the fatal consequences that would otherwise
be inevitable are checked by the gradual growth of inhibitory
processes, such as prudence, reflection, a sense of moral duty, and
in many cases the absence of temptation. From this Dr
Nicholson deduces that &ldquo;in proportion as this development is
prevented or stifled, either owing to an original brain defect or
by lack of proper education or training, so there is the risk of
the individual lapsing into criminal-mindedness or into actual
crime.&rdquo; In the lowest strata of society this risk is largely
increased from the conditions of life. The growth of criminals
is greatly stimulated where people are badly fed, morally and
physically unhealthy, infected with any forms of disease and
vice. In such circumstances, moreover, there is too often the
evil influence of heredity and example. The offspring of criminals
are constantly impelled to follow in their parents&rsquo; footsteps by
the secret springs of nature and pressure of childish imitativeness.
The seed is thrown, so to speak, into a hot-bed where it finds
congenial soil in which to take root and flourish.</p>

<p>Wherever crime shows itself it follows certain well-defined lines
and has its genesis in three dominant mental processes, the result
of marked propensities. These are malice, acquisitiveness and
lust. Malicious crimes may be amplified into offences against
the person originating in hatred, resentment, violent temper,
and rising from mere assaults into manslaughter and murder.
Crimes of greed and acquisitiveness cover the whole range of
thefts, frauds and misappropriation; of larcenies of all sorts;
obtaining by false pretences; receiving stolen goods; robberies;
house-breaking, burglary, forgery and coining. Crimes of lust
embrace the whole range of illicit sexual relations, the result of
ungovernable passion and criminal depravity. The proportions
in which these three categories are manifested have been
worked out in England and Wales to give the following figures.
The percentage in any 100,000 of the population is:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 40%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Crimes of malice</td> <td class="tcc">15%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Crimes of greed</td> <td class="tcc">75%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Crimes of lust</td> <td class="tcc">10%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The members of these categories do not form distinct classes;
their crimes are interdependent and constantly overlap. Crime
in many is progressive and passes through all the stages from
minor offences to the worst crimes. Murder&mdash;the culminating
point of malice&mdash;is constantly preceded by petty larceny; theft
by forcible entry; and robbery is associated with violence and
armed resistance to capture. Criminality rising into its highest
development shows itself under many forms. It is instinctive,
passionate, accidental, deliberate and habitual, the outcome
of abnormal appetite, of weak and disordered moral sense.
The causation of crime varies, but a predominating motive
is idleness, leading to the predatory instincts of gain easily
acquired without the labour of continuous effort. To deprive
the more industrious or more happily placed of their hard-won
earnings or possessions, inspires the bulk of modern serious
crime. It no doubt has produced one peculiar feature in modern
crime: the extensive scale on which it is carried out. The
greatest frauds are now commonly perpetrated; great robberies
are planned in one capital and executed in another. The whole
is worked by wide associations of cosmopolitan criminals.</p>

<p>Other features of modern crime are especially interesting.
It is extraordinarily precocious. Children of quite tender years
commit murders, and boys and girls are frequently to be met
with as professional thieves. Again, the comparative proportions
of crime in the two sexes may be considered. Everywhere
women are less criminal than men. Naturally they have fewer
facilities for committing crimes of violence, although they have
offences peculiar to their sex, such as infanticide, and are more
frequently guilty of poisoning than men by 70% against 30%.
Statistics presented to the Prison Congress at Stockholm fix the
percentage of female criminals at 3% in Japan, the East generally,
South America and some parts of North America. In
some states of the American Union it is 10%; in China, 20%;
in Europe generally it varies between 10% and 21%. In France
the proportion of accused women is fifteen to eighty-five men.
In Great Britain it is now one in four, but has been less. The total
sentenced in 1905-1906 to penal servitude and imprisonment
was 139,389 men and 44,294 women, the balance being made up
by summary convictions. The curious fact in female crime is
that one-seventh of the women committed to prison had already
been convicted from eleven to twenty times. It has been well
said from the above proportions that women are less criminal
according to the figures, because when a woman wants a crime
committed she can generally find a man to do it for her.</p>

<p>It has often been debated whether or not prison methods react
upon the criminality of the country; whether, in other words,
severity of treatment <i>deters</i>, while milder methods encourage the
wrongdoers to despise the penalties imposed by the law.
Evidence for and against the verdict may be drawn from the
whole civilized world. In England, as judged by the increase
or decrease of the prison population, it might be supposed that
the prison system was at one time effective in diminishing crime.
Between 1878 and 1891 there was a steady decrease in numbers
because of it. More recently there has been an appreciable
increase in the number of crimes and proportionately of those
imprisoned. The figures for 1906 showed a distinct increase in
criminality for that year as compared with the years immediately
preceding. The proportion of indictable offences had increased
in 1906 from 59,079 as against 50,494 in 1899, or in the proportion
of 171.01 per 100,000 of the population as against 158.97, a very
marked increase over earlier years. Nevertheless the figures for
1906, although high, are by no means the highest, as on eight
occasions during the fifty odd years for which statistics were
available in 1909 the total crimes exceeded 60,000, and in the
quinquennial period 1860-1864 the annual average was 280 per
100,000 as compared with 171.01 for 1906 and 175 for the quinquennial
period 1902-1906. The quality of the crime varied, and
while offences against property have increased, those against the
person have constantly fallen. Quite half the whole number
of crimes were committed by old offenders (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Recidivism</a></span>).</p>

<p>Statistics have not been kept with the same care in all other
countries, but some authentic figures may be quoted for France,
where the number of thefts increased while offences against the
person diminished. In Belgium there has been a satisfactory
decrease in recent years. In Prussia the prison population has
on the whole increased, but there has been a slight diminution
in more serious crime. Some very noticeable figures are forthcoming
from the United States, and comparison is possible of
the relative amount of crime in the two countries, America and
England. Here the want of statistics covering a large period is
much to be regretted. On the general question serious crime
in the ten years between 1880 and 1890 slightly increased, while
petty crime was very considerably less during the period.
Charges for homicide have been much more numerous. There
were in 1880, 4608, or a ratio of 9.1 to 100,000 of the population;
but in 1890 these offences rose to 7351, or a ratio of 11.7. Comparing
America with England, it has been calculated in round
numbers that the proportion of prisoners to the general population
was in the United States as 1 to every 759, and in England
1 to every 1764 persons. As regards the more serious crimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
the number in English convict prisons was as 1 to 10,000, and
in the American state prisons (the corresponding institutions)
the ratio was 1 to every 1358. In the lesser prisons, <i>i.e.</i> the
English local prisons and the American city or county gaols,
the numbers more nearly approximate, being in England 1
to 2143 and in America 1 to 1721. It has been argued that
much of the crime in America is attributable to the preponderance
of foreign immigrants, but the ratio of native born prisoners is
that of 1237 to the million, of foreign born prisoners 1777 to the
million.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRIMEA<a name="ar267" id="ar267"></a></span> (ancient <i>Tauris</i> or Tauric Chersonese, called by the
Russians by the Tatar name <i>Krym</i> or <i>Crim</i>), a peninsula on the
north side of the Black Sea, forming part of the Russian government
of Taurida, with the mainland of which it is connected
by the Isthmus of Perekop (3-4 m. across). It is rudely rhomboid
in shape, the angles being directed towards the cardinal points,
and measures 200 m. between 44° 23&prime; and 46° 10&prime; N., and 110 m.
between 32° 30&prime; and 36° 40&prime; E. Its area is 9700 sq. m.</p>

<p>Its coasts are washed by the Black Sea, except on the north-east,
where is the Sivash or Putrid Sea, a shallow lagoon separated
from the Sea of Azov by the Arabat spit of sand. The shores are
broken by several bays and harbours&mdash;on the west side of the
Isthmus of Perekop by the Bay of Karkinit; on the south-west
by the open Bay of Kalamita, on the shores of which the allies
landed in 1854, with the ports of Eupatoria, Sevastopol and
Balaklava; by the Bay of Arabat on the north side of the
Isthmus of Yenikale or Kerch; and by the Bay of Kaffa or
Feodosiya (Theodosia), with the port of that name, on the south
side of the same. The south-east coast is flanked at a distance
of 5 to 8 m. from the sea by a parallel range of mountains, the
Yaila-dagh, or Alpine Meadow mountains, and these are backed,
inland, by secondary parallel ranges; but 75% of the remaining
area consists of high arid prairie lands, a southward continuation
of the Pontic steppes, which slope gently north-westwards from
the foot of the Yaila-dagh. The main range of these mountains
shoots up with extraordinary abruptness from the deep floor of
the Black Sea to an altitude of 2000 to 2500 ft., beginning at
the south-west extremity of the peninsula, Cape Fiolente (anc.
<i>Parthenium</i>), supposed to have been crowned by the temple
of Artemis in which Iphigeneia officiated as priestess. On
the higher parts of this range are numerous flat mountain pastures
(Turk, <i>yailas</i>), which, except for their scantier vegetation, are
analogous to the <i>almen</i> of the Swiss Alps, and are crossed by
various passes (<i>bogaz</i>), of which only six are available as carriage
roads. The most conspicuous summits in this range are the
Demir-kapu or Kemal-egherek (5040 ft.), Roman-kosh (5060 ft.),
Chatyr-dagh (5000 ft.), and Karabi-yaila (3975 ft.). The second
parallel range, which reaches altitudes of 1500 to 1900 ft.,
likewise presents steep crags to the south-east and a gentle
slope towards the north-west. In the former slope are thousands
of small caverns, probably inhabited in prehistoric times; and
several rivers pierce the range in picturesque gorges. A valley,
10 to 12 m. wide, separates this range from the main range,
while another valley 2 to 3 m. across separates it from the third
parallel range, which reaches altitudes of only 500 to 850 ft.
Evidences of a fourth and still lower ridge can be traced towards
the south-west.</p>

<p>A number of short streams, none of them anywhere navigable,
leap down the flanks of the mountains by cascades in spring,
<i>e.g.</i> the Chernaya, Belbek, Kacha and Alma, to the Black Sea,
and the Salghir, with its affluent, the Kara-su, to the Sivash
lagoon.</p>

<p>In point of climate and vegetation there exist marked differences
between the open steppes and the south-eastern littoral,
with the slopes of the Yaila-dagh behind it. The former,
although grasses and Liliaceae grow on them in great variety
and luxuriance in the early spring, become completely parched
up by July and August, while the air is then filled with clouds
of dust. There also high winds prevail, and snowstorms, hailstorms
and frost are of common occurrence. Nevertheless this
region produces wheat and barley, rye and oats, and supports
numbers of cattle, sheep and horses. Parts of the steppes are,
however, impregnated with salt, or studded with saline lakes;
there nothing grows except the usual species of <i>Artemisia</i> and
<i>Salsola</i>. As a rule water can only be obtained from wells sunk
200 to 300 ft. deep, and artesian wells are now being bored
in considerable numbers. All over the steppes are scattered
numerous <i>kurgans</i> or burial-mounds of the ancient Scythians.
The picture which lies behind the sheltering screen of the Yaila-dagh
is of an altogether different character. Here the narrow
strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are smothered
with greenery. This Russian Riviera stretches all along the
south-east coast from Cape Sarych (extreme S.) to Feodosiya
(Theodosia), and is studded with summer sea-bathing resorts&mdash;Alupka,
Yalta, Gursuv, Alushta, Sudak, Theodosia. Numerous
Tatar villages, mosques, monasteries, palaces of the Russian
imperial family and Russian nobles, and picturesque ruins of
ancient Greek and medieval fortresses and other buildings cling
to the acclivities and nestle amongst the underwoods of hazel
and other nuts, the groves of bays, cypresses, mulberries, figs,
olives and pomegranates, amongst the vineyards, the tobacco
plantations, and gardens gay with all sorts of flowers; while
the higher slopes of the mountains are thickly clothed with
forests of oak, beech, elm, pines, firs and other Coniferae. Here
have become acclimatized, and grow in the open air, such plants
as magnolias, oleanders, tulip trees, bignonias, myrtles, camellias,
mimosas and many tender fruit-trees. Vineyards cover over
19,000 acres, and the wine they yield (3½ million gallons annually)
enjoys a high reputation. Fruits of all kinds are produced in
abundance. In some winters the tops of the mountains are
covered with snow, but snow seldom falls to the south of them,
and ice, too, is rarely seen in the same districts. The heat of
summer is moderated by breezes off the sea, and the nights
are cool and serene; the winters are mild and healthy. Fever
and ague prevail in the lower-lying districts for a few weeks in
autumn. Dense fogs occur sometimes in March, April and May,
but seldom penetrate inland. The difference of climate between
the different parts of the Crimea is illustrated by the following
data: annual mean, at Melitopol, on the steppe N. of Perekop,
48° Fahr.; at Simferopol, just within the mountains, 50°; at
Yalta, on the south-east coast, 56.5°; the respective January
means being 20°, 31° and 39.5°, and the July means 74°, 70°
and 75.5°. The rainfall is small all over the peninsula, the
annual average on the steppes being 13.8 in., at Simferopol 17.5,
and at Yalta 18 in. It varies greatly, however, from year to
year; thus at Simferopol it ranges between the extremes of
7.5 and 26.4 in.</p>

<p>Other products of the Crimea, besides those already mentioned,
are salt, porphyry and limestone, and ironstone has recently
been brought to light at Kerch. Fish abound all round the
coast, such as red and grey mullet, herring, mackerel, turbot,
soles, plaice, whiting, bream, haddock, pilchard, a species of
pike, whitebait, eels, salmon and sturgeon. Manufacturing
industries are represented by shipbuilding, flour-mills, ironworks,
jam and pickle factories, soap-works and tanneries. The
Tatars excel in a great variety of domestic industries, especially
in the working of leather, wool and metal. A railway, coming
from Kharkov, crosses the peninsula from north to south,
terminating at Sevastopol and sending off branch lines to
Theodosia and Kerch.</p>

<p>The bulk of the population consist of Tatars, who, however, are
racially modified by intermarriage with Greeks and other ethnic
elements. The remainder of the population is made up of
Russians, Germans, Karaite Jews, Greeks and a few Albanians.
The total in 1897 was 853,900, of whom only 150,000 lived in
the towns. Simferopol is the chief town; others of note, in
addition to those already named, are Eupatoria and Bakhchisarai,
the old Tatar capital.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The earliest inhabitants of whom we have any
authentic traces were the Celtic Cimmerians, who were expelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
by the Scythians during the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> A remnant, who
took refuge in the mountains, became known subsequently as
the Tauri. In that same century Greek colonists began to settle
on the coasts, <i>e.g.</i> Dorians from Heraclea at Chersonesus, and
Ionians from Miletus at Theodosia and Panticapaeum (also
called Bosporus). Two centuries later (438 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the archon
or ruler of the last-named assumed the title of king of Bosporus,
a state which maintained close relations with Athens, supplying
that city with wheat and other commodities. The last of these
kings, Paerisades V., being hard pressed by the Scythians, put
himself under the protection of Mithradates VI., king of Pontus,
in 114 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> After the death of this latter sovereign his son
Pharnaces, as a reward for assistance rendered to the Romans
in their war against his father, was (63 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) invested by Pompey
with the kingdom of Bosporus. In 15 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was once more
restored to the king of Pontus, but henceforward ranked as a
tributary state of Rome. During the succeeding centuries
the Crimea was overrun or occupied successively by the Goths
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 250), the Huns (376), the Khazars (8th century), the
Byzantine Greeks (1016), the Kipchaks (1050), and the Mongols
(1237). In the 13th century the Genoese destroyed or seized
the settlements which their rivals the Venetians had made on
the Crimean coasts, and established themselves at Eupatoria,
Cembalo (Balaklava), Soldaia (Sudak), and Kaffa (Theodosia),
flourishing trading towns, which existed down to the conquest
of the peninsula by the Ottoman Turks in 1475. Meanwhile
the Tatars had got a firm footing in the northern and central
parts of the peninsula as early as the 13th century, and after
the destruction of the Golden Horde by Tamerlane they founded
an independent khanate under a descendant of Jenghiz Khan,
who is known as Hadji Ghirai. He and his successors reigned
first at Solkhat (Eski-krym), and from the beginning of the 15th
century at Bakhchi-sarai. But from 1478 they ruled as tributary
princes of the Ottoman empire down to 1777, when having been
defeated by Suvarov they became dependent upon Russia, and
finally in 1783 the whole of the Crimea was annexed to the
Russian empire. Since that date the only important phase of its
history has been the Crimean War of 1854-56, which is treated
of under a separate article. At various times, <i>e.g.</i> after the
acquisition by Russia, after the Crimean War of 1854-56, and
in the first years of the 20th century, the Tatars emigrated in
large numbers to the Ottoman empire.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIMEAN WAR.<a name="ar268" id="ar268"></a></span> The war of 1853-56, usually known by
this name, arose from causes the discussion of which will be
found under the heading <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Turkey</a></span>: <i>History</i>. When Turkey,
after a period of irregular fighting, declared war on Russia in
October 1853, Great Britain and France (subsequently assisted
by Sardinia) intervened in the quarrel. At first this intervention
was represented merely by the presence of an allied squadron
in the Bosporus, but the storm of indignation aroused in Great
Britain and France by the destruction of the Turkish fleet at
Sinope (30th November) soon impelled these powers to more
active measures. On the 27th of January 1854 they declared
war on the tsar, and prepared to carry their armaments to the
Danube. In this, the main, theatre of war, the Turks had
hitherto proved quite capable of holding their own. The
Russian commander, Prince Michael Gorchakov, had crossed
the Pruth with two corps early in July 1853, and had overrun
Moldavia and Wallachia without difficulty. Omar Pasha,
however, disposing of superior forces, was able to check any
further advance. During October, November and December
the Turks won a succession of actions, of which that at Oltenitza
(Nov. 4th) may be particularly mentioned, and a little later
Gorchakov found himself compelled to fight at Cetatea (Tchetati)
before reinforcements could come up. The defeat he sustained
was for the time being decisive (6th Jan. 1854). Three months
later, the Russians, now under command of the veteran Prince
Paskievich, took the offensive in great force. Crossing the
Danube near its mouth at Galatz and Braila, they advanced
through the Dobrudja and closed upon the fortress of Silistria,
which offered a strong and steady resistance, with an effect all
the greater as the Turks from the side of Shumla, now supported
by the leading British and French brigades at Varna, prevented
a close investment. The Turks, however, avoided a decisive
encounter, and the stormers stood ready in the trenches before
Silistria, when the siege was suddenly raised. The decision had
passed into other hands. The tsar had learned that the Austrian
army of observation in Transylvania, 50,000 strong under
Feldzeugmeister Hess, was about to enforce the wishes of the
&ldquo;Four Powers.&rdquo; The Russian offensive was at an end, the
army hastily fell back, and on the 2nd of August 1854 the last
man recrossed the Pruth. The principalities were at once
occupied by Hess.</p>

<p><i>The Invasion of the Crimea.</i>&mdash;The primary object of the war
had thus easily been obtained. But Great Britain and France
were by no means content with a triumph that left untouched
the vast resources of an enemy who was certain to employ them
at the next opportunity. The two nations felt that Sevastopol,
the home of the Black Sea fleet, the port whence Admiral
Nachimov had sailed for Sinope, must be crippled for some years
at least, and as early as June 29th Lord Raglan and Marshal
Saint Arnaud, the allied commanders of England and France,
had received instructions to &ldquo;concert measures for the siege
of Sevastopol.&rdquo; Dynastic considerations reinforced the arguments
of policy and popular opinion in the case of France; in
Great Britain soldier and civilian alike saw the menace of a
Russian Mediterranean fleet in the unfinished forts and busy
dockyards. The popular strategy for once coincided with the
views of the responsible leaders. Yet there is no sign that
either the commanders on the spot or their governments realized
the magnitude of the undertaking. Few but the most urgently
necessary preparations were made, and cholera, breaking out
virulently amongst the French at this time, reduced the army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
at Varna, and even the fleet at sea, to impotence. The troops
were so weakened that, even in September, the five-mile march
from camp to transport exhausted most of the men. Heavy
weather still further delayed the start, and it was not until
the 7th of September that the expedition began to cross the
Black Sea. One hundred and fifty war-vessels and transports
conveyed the army, which, guarded on all sides by the fighting
fleet, crossed without incident and drew up on the Crimean coast
on September 13th. Tactical considerations prevailed in the
choice of place. The landlocked harbours south of Sevastopol
were for the time being neglected, and a spot known as Old
Fort preferred, because the long beach, the heavy metal of the
ships&rsquo; broadsides, and a line of lagoons covering the front
offered singularly favourable conditions for the delicate operation
of disembarkation. Still, on this side of Sevastopol there was
no good harbour, and it is quite open to question whether in
this case the strategic necessities of the situation were not
neglected in favour of purely tactical and temporary advantages.
As a matter of fact no opposition was offered to the landing,
but the weather prevented the disembarkation being completed
until the 18th. St Arnaud and Raglan had at this time under
their orders 51,000 British, French and Turkish infantry, 1000
British cavalry, and 128 guns, and on the 19th this force (less
some detachments) began the southward march in order of
battle, the British (who alone had their cavalry present) on the
exposed left flank, the French next the sea, the fleet moving
in the same direction parallel to the troops.</p>

<p><i>The Alma.</i>&mdash;Old Fort was beyond the reach of Menshikov,
the Russian commander, but, as the fortress communicated with
the interior of Russia via Kerch and Simferopol, it was to be
expected that he would either accept battle on the Sevastopol
road, or cover Simferopol by a flank attack on Lord Raglan.
Both these contingencies were provided for by the order of
march, and in due course it was ascertained that the Russians
adopted the former alternative, and barred the Sevastopol road
on the heights of the river Alma. Menaced by the guns of the
fleet, Menshikov had wheeled back his left, and at the same time
he strengthened his right in order to cover the Simferopol road.
From this it followed naturally that the brunt of the attack fell
upon the British divisions, whilst the French, nearer the sea,
struck to some extent <i>dans le vide</i>. The two commanders, after
a reconnaissance, decided upon their plan. The French divisions
in echelon from the right were to cross the river and force Menshikov
inwards, whilst the British were to move straight to their
front against the strongest part of the Russian line. Substantially
this plan was carried out on the 20th of September. Owing to
want of men (he had but 36,400 against over 50,000) Menshikov
was unable to hold his left wing very strongly, and the French
were scarcely checked save by physical obstacles; but opposite
the British force the ground sloped glacis-wise up to the Russian
line, and nothing but their iron discipline, the best heritage of
the Peninsular War, brought them victorious to the crest of
Kurghane hill. The Russians had no option but to retreat,
which they did without molestation. The allies lost about 3000
men, mostly British (though Prince Napoleon&rsquo;s men also suffered
heavily); the Russians reported 5709 casualties.</p>

<p><i>The March on Sevastopol.</i>&mdash;On the 23rd of September the
advance was resumed, and by the 25th Sevastopol was in full
view of the allied outposts. It was now that the necessary
consequences of the choice of Old Fort as the landing-place
presented themselves as a problem for instant solution. Whatever
chance there had been of assaulting the north side of
Sevastopol was now gone. Menshikov had sacrificed some ships
in order to seal up the harbour mouth, and naval co-operation
in attack was now impossible, while the other Russian ships
could in safety aid the defenders with their heavy guns. A
siege, based on the beach of Old Fort or the open roads of
Kacha, was out of the question, as was re-embarkation for a
fresh landing. There remained only a flank march by Mackenzie&rsquo;s
farm and the river Chernaya. Once established on the south
side, the allies could use the excellent harbours of Kamiesh
and Balaklava; this could almost certainly be effected without
fighting, while in besieging Sevastopol itself and not merely
the north side, the allies would be striking at the heart. But
a flank march is almost always in itself a hazardous undertaking,
and in this case the invaders were required further to abandon
their line of retreat on Old Fort. In point of fact, the army,
covered by a division opposite the Russian works, successfully
accomplished the task. At the same moment Menshikov, after
providing for the defence of Sevastopol, had marched out with
a field army towards Bakhchiserai, and on the 25th of September
each army, without knowing it, actually crossed the other&rsquo;s
front. On arrival at Balaklava the allies regained contact with
the fleet, and the detachment left on the north side, its mission
being at an end, followed the same route and rejoined the main
body. The French now took possession of Kamiesh, the British
of Balaklava.</p>

<p><i>Beginning of the Siege.</i>&mdash;Thus secured, the allies closed upon
the south side of the fortress. A siege corps was formed, and the
British army and General Bosquet&rsquo;s French corps covered its
operations against interruption from the Russian field army.
The harbour of Sevastopol, formed by the estuary of the Chernaya,
was protected against attack by sea not only by the Russian
war-vessels, afloat and sunken, but also by heavy granite forts
on the south side and by the works which had defied the allies on
the north. For the town itself and the Karabelnaya suburb
the trace of the works had been laid down for years. The
Malakoff, a great tower of stone, covered the suburb, flanked
on either side by the Redan and the Little Redan. The town
was covered by a line of works marked by the Flagstaff and
central bastions, and separated from the Redan by the inner
harbour. Lieut.-Col. Todleben, the Russian chief engineer,
had very early begun work on these sites, and daily re-creating,
rearming and improving the fortifications, finally connected
them by a continuous enceinte. Yet Sevastopol was not, early
in October 1854, the towering fortress it afterwards became,
and Todleben himself maintained that, had the allies immediately
assaulted, they would have succeeded in taking the place.
There were, however, many reasons against so decided a course,
and it was not until the 17th of October that the first attack
took place. All that day a tremendous artillery duel raged.
The French siege corps lost heavily and its guns were overpowered.
The fleet engaged the harbour batteries close inshore, and
suffered a loss of 500 men, besides severe damage to the ships.
On the other hand the British siege batteries silenced the Malakoff
and its annexes, and, if failure had not occurred at the other
points of attack, an assault might have succeeded. As it was,
Todleben, by daybreak, had repaired and improved the damaged
works. Meanwhile General Canrobert had succeeded St Arnaud
(who died on the 29th of September) in the joint leadership of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
the allies. It was not long before Menshikov and the now
augmented field army from Bakhchiserai appeared on the
Chernaya and moved towards the Balaklava lines and the British
base.</p>

<p><i>Balaklava.</i>&mdash;A long line of works on the upland secured the
siege corps from interference, and the Balaklava lines themselves
were strong, but the low Vorontsov ridge between the two was
weakly held, and here the Russian commander hoped to sever
the line of communications. On the 25th of October Liprandi&rsquo;s
corps carried its slight redoubts at the first rush. But the British
cavalry stationed at the foot of the upland was situated on their
flank, and as the Russian cavalry moved towards Kadikoï, the
&ldquo;Heavy Brigade&rdquo; under General Scarlett charged home with
such effect that Menshikov&rsquo;s troopers only rallied behind their
field batteries near Traktir bridge. At the same time some of the
Russian squadrons, coming upon the British 93rd regiment
outside the Balaklava lines, were completely broken by the steady
volleys of the &ldquo;thin red line.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Light Brigade&rdquo; of British
cavalry, farther north, had hitherto remained inactive, even
when the Russians, broken by the &ldquo;Heavies,&rdquo; fled across their
front. The cavalry commander, Lord Lucan, now received
orders to prevent the withdrawal of the guns taken by Liprandi.
The aide-de-camp who carried the order was killed by the first
shell, and the whole question of responsibility for what followed
is wrapped in obscurity. Lord Cardigan led the Light Brigade
straight at the Russian field batteries, behind which the enemy&rsquo;s
squadrons had re-formed. From the guns in front, on the
Fedukhin heights, and on the captured ridge to their right,
the advancing squadrons at once met a deadly converging fire,
but the gallant troopers nevertheless reached the guns and cut
down the artillerymen. Small parties even charged the cavalry
behind, and at least two unbroken squadrons struck out right and
left with success, but the combat could only end in one way.
The 4th Chasseurs d&rsquo;Afrique relieved the British left by a dashing
charge. The &ldquo;Heavies&rdquo; made as if to advance, but came under
such a storm of fire that they were withdrawn. By twos and
threes the gallant survivors of the &ldquo;Light Brigade&rdquo; made their
way back. Two-thirds of its numbers were left on the field, and
the day closed with the Russians still in possession of the
Vorontsov ridge.</p>

<p><i>Inkerman.</i>&mdash;If the heights lost in this action were not absolutely
essential to the safety of the allies, the point selected for the
next attempt at relief was of vital importance. The junction
of the covering army and the siege corps near Inkerman was the
scene of a slight action on the day following Balaklava, and
the battle of Inkerman followed on the 5th of November. By
that time the French had made good the losses of the 17th of
October, their approaches were closing upon Flagstaff bastion,
and the British batteries daily maintained their superiority
over the Malakoff. On the 5th there was to have been a meeting
of generals to fix the details of an assault, but at dawn the
Russian army, now heavily reinforced from Odessa, was attacking
with the utmost fury the British divisions guarding the angle
between Bosquet and the siege corps. The battle of Inkerman
defies description; every regiment, every group of men bore its
own separate part in the confused and doubtful struggle, save
when leaders on either side obtained a momentary control over
its course by means of reserves which, carrying all before them
with their original impetus, soon served but to swell the mêlée.
It was a &ldquo;soldiers&rsquo; battle&rdquo; pure and simple. After many
hours of the most desperate fighting the arrival of Bosquet
(hitherto contained by a force on the Balaklava ground) confirmed
a success won by supreme tenacity against overwhelming
odds, and Menshikov sullenly drew off his men, leaving over
12,000 on the field. The allies had lost about 3300 men, of
whom more than two-thirds belonged to the small British force
on which the strain of the battle fell heaviest. Their losses
included several generals who could ill be spared, but they had
held their ground, which was all that was required of them, with
almost unrivalled tenacity. Lord Raglan was promoted to be
field marshal after the battle.</p>

<p><i>The Winter of 1854-1855.</i>&mdash;It was now obvious that the army
must winter in the Crimea, and preparations in view of this
were begun betimes. But on the night of November 14th a
violent storm arose which wrecked nearly thirty vessels with
their precious cargoes of treasure, medical comforts, forage,
clothing and other necessaries. After so grave a calamity it
was to be expected that the troops would be called upon to
undergo great hardships. But the direct cause of sufferings
that have become a byword for the utmost depths of misery
was the loss of twenty days&rsquo; forage in the great storm. Of food
and clothing enough was in store to tide over temporary difficulties,
but the only paved road from Balaklava to the British
camps was now in Russian hands, and the few starving transport
animals were utterly inadequate for the work of drawing wagons
over the miry plain; things went from bad to worse with Raglan&rsquo;s
troops, until from the outposts before the Redan to the hospitals
at Scutari a state of the utmost misery prevailed, relieved only
by the example of devotion and self-sacrifice set by officers and
men. The British hospital returns showed eight thousand sick
at the end of November. Even the French, whose base of
Kamiesh had escaped the storm, were not unhurt by the severity
of the winter, but Napoleon III. sent freely all the men his
general asked, while the Russians in Sevastopol, who had made
long painful marches from the interior, were the survivors of
the fittest. Canrobert took over the lines before the Malakoff
to relieve the British. He had at the end of January 1855
78,000 men for duty; Raglan could barely muster 12,000. But,
with the advent of spring, paved roads and a railway were
promptly taken in hand, and during the remainder of the war
the British troops were so well cared for that their death-rate
was lower than at home, while the hospitals in rear, thanks to
the energy and devotion of Florence Nightingale and her nurses,
became models of good management.</p>

<p><i>Course of the Siege.</i>&mdash;Meanwhile the siege works were making
but slow progress, and the fortress grew day by day under the
skilful direction of Todleben. Rifle-pits pushed out in front of
the defenders&rsquo; lines were connected so as to form a veritable
envelope. Beyond the left wing a new line, the &ldquo;White Works,&rdquo;
sprang up in a single night, and the hill of the Mamelon was
suddenly crowned with a lunette to cover the still defiant
Malakoff. But the absence of bomb-proof cover exposed the
huge working parties necessary for these defences to an almost
incessant <i>feu d&rsquo;enfer</i>, by which the Russians every week suffered
the losses of a pitched battle. Meanwhile the field army was
idle, Menshikov had been replaced by Prince Michael Gorchakov,
Liprandi&rsquo;s corps had withdrawn from the Vorontsov ridge, and
Omar Pasha, with a detachment of the troops he had led at
Oltenitza and Cetatea, repulsed a Russian attack on Eupatoria
(Feb. 17th). The besiegers steadily approached the White
Works, Mamelon, Redan and Flagstaff bastion, and as spring
arrived the logistic and material advantages of the allies returned.
On Easter Sunday (April 8th, 1855) another terrific bombardment
began, which lasted almost uninterruptedly for ten days. The
White Works and the Mamelon were practically destroyed,
and the Russians, drawn up in momentary expectation of
assault, lost between six and seven thousand men.</p>

<p>But the bombardment ceased, and assault did not follow.
For, at the allied headquarters and at Paris, grave differences
of opinion on the conduct of the war had developed. Napoleon
III. wished active operations to be undertaken against the
Simferopol field army, whereas the leaders on the spot, while
admitting the theoretical soundness of the French emperor&rsquo;s
views, considered that they were wholly beyond the means of
the two armies. The discussions culminated in Canrobert&rsquo;s
resignation of the chief command, though he would not leave
the army, and took a subordinate post, which he filled with great
distinction to the end of the war. His successor, General
Pélissier, was a soldier trained in the hard school of Algerian
warfare, and endowed, as was soon evident, with the most
inflexible resolution of character. He did not hesitate to take up
and maintain a position of decided opposition to his sovereign&rsquo;s
views; and the capture of Kerch (24th May 1855), carried out
by a joint expedition, was the first earnest of new vigour in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
operations. This success served all the purposes of a complete
investment of Sevastopol, the want of which had greatly troubled
the allied generals. The line of communication and supply
between Sevastopol and the interior was cut, vast stores intended
for the fortress were destroyed, and the sea of Azov was cleared
of shipping. On the 25th Canrobert established himself on the
Fedukhin heights, his right continued along the Chernaya by
General la Marmora&rsquo;s newly arrived Sardinians, 15,000 strong,
while masses of Turks occupied the Vorontsov ridge and the
old Balaklava battlefield.</p>

<p>As June approached, Raglan and Pélissier, who, unlike most
allied commanders, were in complete accord and sympathy,
initiated very vigorous methods of attack. They decided that
the works west of Flagstaff could be comparatively neglected,
and the full weight of the bombardment once more fell upon
the Mamelon and the Malakoff. Once more these works were
reduced to ruins, but the rest of the defences still held out.</p>

<p><i>The Assault of the Redan.</i>&mdash;On the 7th of June 1855 the French
stormed the Mamelon and the White Works, the British captured
and maintained some quarries close to the Redan, and next
morning the whole of Todleben&rsquo;s envelope had become a siege-parallel.
The losses were, as usual, heavy, 8500 to the Russians,
6883 to the allies. This was merely a preliminary to the great
assault fixed for the 18th, the fortieth anniversary of Waterloo.
But meanwhile Pélissier&rsquo;s temper and Raglan&rsquo;s health had been
strained to breaking-point by continued dissensions with Paris
and London. The telegraph, a new strategic factor, daily
tormented the unfortunate commanders with the latest ideas
of the Paris strategists, and on the fateful day the two armies
rushed on to failure. The French attack on the Malakoff
dwindled away into a meaningless fire-fight: the British,
attacking the Redan in face of a cross-fire of one hundred heavy
guns, at first succeeded in entering the work, but in the end
sustained a bloody and disastrous repulse. Of the six generals
who led the two attacks, four were killed and one wounded, and
on the 17th and 18th the losses to the Russians were 5400, to the
allies 4000. But the defenders&rsquo; resources were almost at an end,
and the bombardment reopened at once with increased fury.
On the 20th Todleben was wounded, and soon afterwards
Nakhimov, the victor of Sinope, found a grave by the side of
three other admirals who had fallen in the defence. Pélissier
resolutely clung to his plans, in spite of the failure of the 18th,
against ever-increasing opposition at home. Raglan, worn out
by his troubles and heartbroken at the Redan failure, died on
the 28th, mourned by none more deeply than by his stern
colleague.</p>

<p><i>The Storming of the Malakoff.</i>&mdash;During July the Russians lost
on an average 250 men a day, and at last it was decided that
Gorchakov and the field army must make another attack at the
Chernaya&mdash;the first since Inkerman. On the 16th of August
the corps of Generals Liprandi and Read furiously attacked the
37,000 French and Sardinian troops on the heights above Traktir
Bridge. The assailants came on with the greatest determination,
but the result was never for one moment doubtful. At the end
of the day the Russians drew off baffled, leaving 260 officers and
8000 men on the field. The allies only lost 1700. With this
defeat vanished the last chance of saving Sevastopol. On the
same day (Aug. 16th) the bombardment once more reduced the
Malakoff and its dependencies to impotence, and it was with
absolute confidence in the result that Pélissier planned the final
assault. On the 8th of September 1855 at noon, the whole of
Bosquet&rsquo;s corps suddenly swarmed up to the Malakoff. The
fighting was of the most desperate kind. Every casemate, every
traverse, was taken and retaken time after time, but the French
maintained the prize, and though the British attack on the
Redan once more failed, the Russians crowded in that work
became at once the helpless target of the siege guns. Even on
the far left, opposite Flagstaff and Central bastions, there was
severe hand-to-hand fighting, and throughout the day the bombardment
mowed down the Russian masses along the whole line.
The fall of the Malakoff was the end of the siege. All night the
Russians were filing over the bridges to the north side, and on
the 9th the victors took possession of the empty and burning
prize. The losses in the last assault had been very heavy, to
the allies over 10,000 men, to the Russians 13,000. No less than
nineteen generals had fallen on that day. But the crisis was
surmounted. With the capture of Sevastopol the war loses its
absorbing interest. No serious operations were undertaken
against Gorchakov, who with the field army and the remnant of
the garrison held the heights at Mackenzie&rsquo;s Farm. But Kinburn
was attacked by sea, and from the naval point of view the attack
is interesting as being the first instance of the employment of
ironclads. An armistice was agreed upon on the 26th of February
and the definitive peace of Paris was signed on the 30th of March
1856.</p>

<p><i>Decisive Importance of the Victory.</i>&mdash;The importance of the
siege of Sevastopol, from the strategical point of view, lies
beneath the surface. It may well be asked, why did the fall of a
place, at first almost unfortified, bring the master of the Russian
empire to his knees? At first sight Russia would seem to be
almost invulnerable to a sea power, and no first success, however
crushing, could have humbled Nicholas I. Indeed the capture
of Sevastopol in October 1854 would have been far from decisive
of the war, but once the tsar had decided to defend to the last
this arsenal, the necessity for which he was in the best position
to appreciate, the factor of unlimited resources operated in the
allies&rsquo; favour. The sea brought to the invaders whatever they
needed, whilst the desert tracks of southern Russia were marked
at every step with the corpses of men and horses who had fallen
on the way to Sevastopol. The hasty nature, too, of the fortifications,
which, daily crushed by the fire of a thousand guns, had
to be re-created every night, made huge and therefore unprotected
working parties necessary, and the losses were correspondingly
heavy. The double cause of loss completely exhausted even
Russia&rsquo;s resources, and, when large bodies of militia appeared
in line of battle at Traktir Bridge, it was obvious that the end
was at hand. The novels of Tolstoy give a graphic picture of the
war from the Russian point of view; the miseries of the desert
march, the still greater miseries of life in the casemates, and the
almost daily ordeal of manning the lines under shell-fire to meet an
assault that might or might not come; and no student of the
siege can leave it without feeling the profoundest respect for the
courage, discipline and stubborn loyalty of the defenders.</p>

<p><i>Minor Operations.</i>&mdash;A few words may be added on the minor
operations of the war. The Asiatic frontier was the scene of
severe fighting between the Turks and the Russians. Hindered
at first by Shamyl and his Caucasian mountaineers, the Russians
stood on the defensive during 1853, but next year they took the
offensive, and, while their coast column won an action on the 16th
of June at the river Churuk, another force from Erivan gained an
important success on the Araxes and took Bayazid, and General
Bebutov completely defeated a Turkish column from Kars at
Kuruk Dere (July 31st, 1854). Next year Count Muraviev
completely isolated the garrison of Kars, which made a magnificent
defence, inspired by Fenwick Williams Pasha and other
British officers. In one assault alone 7000 Russians were killed
and wounded, and it was not until the 26th of November 1855
that the fortress was forced to surrender. The naval operations
in the Baltic furnish many interesting examples for the study
of naval war. The allied fleet in 1854, after a first repulse,
succeeded in landing a French force under Baraguay d&rsquo;Hilliers
before Bomarsund, and the place fell after an eight days&rsquo; siege.
In 1855 seventy allied warships appeared before Kronstadt,
which defied them. Reinforced they attacked Sveåborg, but
after two days&rsquo; fighting had to draw off baffled.</p>

<p>The numbers engaged in the Crimean War and the cost in men
and money is stated in round numbers below. In May 1855 the
Crimean theatre of war occupied 174,500 allies (of whom 32,000
were British) and 170,000 Russians. The losses in battle were:
allies 70,000 men, Russians 128,700; and the total losses, from
all causes and in all theatres of the war: allies 252,600 (including
45,000 English), Russians 256,000 men (Berndt, <i>Die Zahl im
Kriege</i>, p. 35). In the siege of Sevastopol the Russians are stated
by Berndt to have lost 102,670 men dead, wounded and missing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
Mulhall (<i>Dict. of Statistics</i>, 1903 ed., pp. 586-587) gives much
greater losses to each of the four powers principally engaged.
The cost of the war in money is stated by Mulhall to have been
£69,000,000 to Great Britain, £93,000,000 to France, £142,000,000
to Russia.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIMINAL LAW.<a name="ar269" id="ar269"></a></span> By criminal, or penal, law is now understood
the law as to the definition, trial and punishment of crimes,
<i>i.e.</i> of acts or omissions forbidden by law which affect injuriously
public rights, or constitute a breach of duties due to the whole
community. The sovereign is taken to be the person injured by
the crime, as he represents the whole community, and prosecutions
are in his name. Criminal law includes the rules as to the
prevention, the investigation, prosecution and punishment of
crime (<i>q.v.</i>). It lays down what constitutes a criminal offence,
what proof is necessary to establish the fact of a criminal offence
and the culpability of the offender, what excuse or justification
for the act or omission can be legally admitted, what procedure
should be followed in a criminal court, what degrees and kinds
of punishment should be imposed for the various offences which
come up for trial. Finally, it regulates the constitution of the
tribunals established for the trial of offences according to the
gravity of the infraction of law, and deals with the organization
of the police and the proper management of prisons, and the
maintenance of prison discipline. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Evidence</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prison</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Police</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Many acts or omissions, which are technically criminal and
classified as offences and punished by fine or imprisonment,
cannot be said to have a strictly criminal character, since they
do not fall within the popular conception of crime. To this class
belong such matters as stopping up a highway under claim of
right, or failing to repair it, or allowing a chimney to emit
black smoke in excessive quantities, or to catch fire from being
unswept, or breach of building by-laws, or driving a motor car
on a highway at a speed in excess of the legal limit. Such breaches
of law are under the French law described as <i>contraventions</i>.
In England most of them are described as petty misdemeanours
or offences punishable on summary conviction, or less happily
as &ldquo;summary offences,&rdquo; and some writers speak of them as
<i>mala prohibita</i> as distinguished from <i>mala in se</i>, <i>i.e.</i> as not involving
any breach of ordinary morality other than a breach of
positive regulations. Continental jurists at times speak of
crimes <i>de droit commun</i> (<i>i.e.</i> offences common to all systems
of law as distinguished from offences which are crimes only by a
particular municipal law). To this class of crimes <i>de droit commun</i>
belong most of the offences included in extradition treaties.</p>

<p>Criminal and civil law overlap, and many acts or omissions
are not only &ldquo;wrongs&rdquo; for which the person injured is entitled
to recover compensation for his own personal injury or damage,
but also &ldquo;offences&rdquo; for which the offender may be prosecuted
and punished in the interest of the state. In non-English
European systems care is taken to prevent civil remedies from
being extinguished by punishment: it is quite usual for the
civil and criminal remedies to be pursued concurrently, the
individual appearing as <i>partie civile</i> and receiving an award of
compensation by the judgment which determines the punishment
to be inflicted for the offence against the state. Under English
law it is now exceptional to allow civil and criminal remedies
to be pursued concurrently or in the same proceeding, or to
award compensation to the injured party in criminal proceedings,
and he is usually left to seek his remedy by action. Among the
exceptions are the restitution of stolen goods on conviction
of the thief if the prosecution has been at the instance or with
the aid of the owner of the goods (Larceny Act 1861, § 100),
and the award of compensation to persons who have suffered
injury to property by felony (Forfeiture Act 1870).</p>

<p>As Sir Henry Maine says (<i>Ancient Law</i>, ed. 1906, p. 381), &ldquo;All
civilized systems of law agree in drawing a distinction between
offences against the state or community (crimes or
<i>crimina</i>) and offences against the individual (wrongs,
<span class="sidenote">Development of modern criminal law.</span>
<i>torts</i> or <i>delicta</i>).&rdquo; But the process of historical development
by which this distinction has been ultimately
established has given great occasion for study of
early laws and institutions by eminent men, whose researches
have disclosed the extremely gradual evolution of the modern
notion of criminal law enforced by the state from the primitive
conceptions and customs of barbarous or semi-civilized communities.
Of the oldest codes or digests of customs which
are available to the student it has been said the more archaic
a code the fuller and minuter is its penal legislation: but this
penal legislation is not true criminal law; it is the law, not of
crimes, but of wrongs. The intervention of the community
or tribe is in the first instance to persuade or compel the wronged
person or his family or tribe to abandon private vengeance or a
blood feud and to accept compensation for the wrong collectively
or individually sustained; and in the tariffs of compensation
preserved in early laws the importance of the injured person
was the measure of the compensation or vengeance which he
was recognized to be entitled to exact, and the scales of punishment
or compensation are fixed from this point of view.</p>

<p>The laws of Khammurabi (2285-2242), the oldest extant code,
contain definite schemes and scales of offences and punishments,
and indicate the existence of tribunals to try the
offences and to award the appropriate remedy. The
<span class="sidenote">Babylon.</span>
punishments are very severe. It is not distinctly indicated
whether the proceedings were at the instance of the state or
the person wronged, but compensation and penalty could be
awarded in the same proceeding, and the provisions as to the
<i>lex talionis</i> and scale of compensation for injuries tend to show
that the procedure was on private complaint and not on behalf
of the state (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Babylonian Law</a></span>).</p>

<p>Of the early criminal laws of Greece only fragments survive,
<i>e.g.</i> those of Solon and Draco. In Athens in early times crime
was dealt with in the Areopagus from the point of view
<span class="sidenote">Greece.</span>
of religion and by the archons from the point of view of
compensation: and it was only when the state interests were
directly affected that proceedings by way of <span class="grk" title="eisangelia">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span> or
impeachment were taken. In classical times crimes fell to be
tried by panels of jurors or judges drawn from the assembly and
described as <span class="grk" title="dikastêria">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#945;</span>.</p>

<p>The earliest materials for ascertaining the criminal law of
Rome are to be found in the Twelve Tables, Table VIII. The
criminal law of imperial Rome is collected in books 47
and 48 of the Digest. The classification of crimes
<span class="sidenote">Rome.</span>
therein is capricious and anomalous. &ldquo;In the early Roman
law the idea of legislative power was so fully grasped and that
of judicial power so little understood that the criminal jurisdiction
arose in the form of a legislative enactment applicable
to particular cases.&rdquo; Crimes were classified according to the
mode of prosecution into:</p>

<p>1. <i>Publica judicia</i>, dealing with crimes specifically forbidden
by definite laws, which took the place of the standing commissions
(<i>quaestiones perpetuae</i>) of the time of the republic.
In the earlier stages of Roman law the state only interfered to
punish offences which gravely affected it, and did so by <i>privilegia</i>,
which correspond to impeachment or Bill of Pains and Penalties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Extraordinaria crimina</i>, crimes for which no special procedure
or punishment was provided: the punishment being,
within limits, left to the discretion of the judge and the
prosecution to the injured party.</p>

<p>3. <i>Privata delicta</i>, offences for which a special form of action
was open to the injured party, <i>e.g. actio furti</i>.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of tribunals under the republic was replaced
under the empire by a complete organization of the judiciary
throughout the districts (dioceses) under the supervision of the
emperor in his privy council (see Maine, <i>Ancient Law</i>, ed. 1906,
p. 393). Public prosecution under the empire began by arrest of
the accused, who was taken before an <i>eirenarcha</i>, who examined
him (by torture in the case of a slave or parricide) and sent him
on for trial before the <i>praeses</i> of the diocese (<span class="grk" title="dioikêsis">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>). Private
prosecution followed, a procedure closely resembling that of
civil actions, beginning with <i>citatio</i> (summons), followed by
<i>libellus</i> or accusation, and appointment of a day for hearing.
The right of either party to call witnesses was very imperfectly
established.</p>

<p>The early laws of the Celtic races are preserved as to Wales
in the laws of Hywel Dda, and as to Ireland in the Book of
Aicill and other Brehon law tracts, which are professional
collections of precedents and formulae made
<span class="sidenote">Celtic law.</span>
by the hereditary law caste (Brehons), whose business it was
&ldquo;to pass sentence from precedents and commentaries.&rdquo; (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brehon Laws</a></span>.) The development of Celtic law was arrested
by the Saxon and Anglo-Norman conquest: but the materials
preserved indicate an origin common with that of Germanic law.</p>

<p>The special characteristics of Irish criminal law, if it can be
so called, were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The law was customary and theoretically unchangeable,
and no legislative or judicial authority existed to alter or
enforce it.</p>

<p>2. All crimes were treated as wrongs, for which compensation
was made by assessment of damages by a consensual tribunal
whose power to make awards depended on submission of the
parties and the ultimate sanction of public opinion or custom.
A customary tariff for compensation existed for all offences
from wilful murder downwards. No crime was unamendable.
The Irish law recognized a body price or compensation (S. <i>bot</i>)
and an honour price or <i>eric</i> (S. <i>wer</i>), for which the family or tribe
of the offender was collectively liable; but there is no clearly
ascertained equivalent to the Saxon <i>wite</i>, or fine to the chief.</p>

<p>The laws of the Germanic tribes, so far as preserved in the
<i>Germania</i> of Tacitus, and in the compilations of customs known
as the Salic and Ripuarian laws, the Leges Barbarorum,
the Dooms of Æthelberht and the collections of
<span class="sidenote">Germanic law.</span>
Anglo-Saxon law and custom (to be found in Thorpe&rsquo;s
<i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of England</i>), do not indicate any
adequate or definite division between crimes and causes of civil
action, but, like the laws of Babylon, recognize the system and
contain the tariffs of compensation for wrongs. The idea of
the compensation was originally to put an end (<i>finis</i>) to blood
feuds and private war or vengeance.</p>

<p>These laws formed the foundation of the criminal law of
Germany, including the Netherlands, of England and of Scandinavia.
But in each country the development of criminal law
has been affected by influences other than Germanic, mainly
consisting in an infusion more or less great of ideas derived from
Roman law. In England under Alfred some part of the Levitical
law (Exod. xxi. 12-15) was incorporated, just as in 1567 the
criminal law as to incest in Scotland was taken bodily from
Leviticus xviii.</p>

<p>The stage which the development of criminal law had reached
in England by the reign of Edward the Confessor is thus described
by Pollock and Maitland (<i>Hist. Eng. Law</i>, ii. 447):
&ldquo;On the eve of the Norman Conquest what we may call
<span class="sidenote">Anglo-Saxon law.</span>
the criminal law of England (but it was also the law
of torts or civil wrongs) contained four elements which
deserve attention: Its past history had in the main consisted
of the varying relations between them. We have to speak of
outlawry, of the blood feud (<i>faidus</i>), of the tariffs of <i>wer</i> and <i>wite</i>
(<i>fredus</i> or <i>friede</i>), and <i>bot</i>, of punishment in life and limb. As
regards the malefactor the community may assume one of four
attitudes: it may make war on him; it may have him exposed
to the vengeance of those whom he has wronged; it may suffer
him to make atonement; it may inflict on him a determinate
punishment, death, mutilation or the like.&rdquo; The <i>wite</i> or sum
paid to the king or lord is now thought to have been originally
not a penalty but a fee for time and trouble taken in hearing and
determining a controversy. But at an early stage fines for
breach of peace were imposed. An evil result from the public
point of view followed from the system of atoning for crime by
pecuniary mulct. &ldquo;Criminal jurisdiction became a source of
revenue.&rdquo; So early as Canute&rsquo;s time certain crimes were pleas of
the crown; but grants of criminal jurisdiction, with the attendant
forfeitures, were freely made to prelates, towns and lords of
manors, and some traces of this jurisdiction still survive (<i>e.g.</i>
the criminal jurisdiction of the justices of the <i>soke</i> (<i>soc</i>) of
Peterborough, and the rights of some boroughs, <i>e.g.</i> Nottingham,
to forfeitures). Outlawry soon ceased to be a mode of punishment,
and became, as it still is, a process to compel submission to
justice (Crown Office Rules, 1906, rules 88-110). Certain crimes,
such as murder, rape, arson and burglary, became unamendable
or bootless, <i>i.e.</i> placed the offender&rsquo;s life, limb, lands and goods
at the king&rsquo;s mercy. These crimes came to be generally described
by the name felony (<i>q.v.</i>). Other crimes became punishable by
fines which took the place of <i>wites</i>. These were styled trespasses
and correspond to what is now called misdemeanour (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Minor acts of violence, dishonesty or nuisance, were dealt with
in seigniorial and borough courts by presentment of the jurors
of courts baron and courts leet, and punished by fine
or in some cases by pillory, tumbril or stocks. Grave
<span class="sidenote">Anglo-Norman period.</span>
acts were dealt with by the sheriff as breaches of the
peace. He sat with the freeholders in the county
court, which sat twice a year, or in the hundred court, which sat
every four weeks. So far as this involved dealing with pleas
of the crown the sheriff&rsquo;s jurisdiction was abolished and was
ultimately replaced by that of the justices or conservators of
the peace. The sheriff then ceased to be a judge in criminal cases,
but remained and still is in law responsible for the peace of his
county, and is the officer for the execution of the law. The royal
control over crime was effectually established by the itinerant
justices sent regularly throughout the realm, who not only dealt
with the ordinary proprietary and fiscal rights of the crown
but also with the graver crimes (treason and felony), and ultimately
were commissioned to deal with the less grave offences
now classed as indictable misdemeanours. The change resulted
from the strengthening of royal authority throughout England,
which enabled the crown gradually to enlarge the pleas of the
crown and to weaken and finally to supersede the criminal
jurisdiction, notably of the sheriff, but also of prelates and lords
in ecclesiastical and other manors and franchises. &ldquo;In the early
English laws and constitution there existed a national sovereignty
and original criminal jurisdiction, but the ideas of legislative
power and crime were very slowly developed.&rdquo; During the 12th
century the criminal law was affected by the influence of the
church, which introduced into it elements from the Canon and
Mosaic laws, and also by the memory of the Roman empire and
the renewed study of the Roman law, which enabled lawyers
to draw a clearer distinction than had before been recognized
between the criminal (<i>dolus</i>) and civil (<i>culpa</i>) aspect of wrongful
acts. The Statute of Treasons (1351) is to a large extent an
admixture of Roman with feudal law; and to the same source
is probably due the more careful analysis of the mental elements
necessary to create criminal responsibility, summed up in
the somewhat misleading expression <i>nemo reus est nisi mens
sit rea</i>.</p>

<p>In the 14th century justices of the peace and quarter sessions
were established to deal with offences not sufficiently important
for the king&rsquo;s judges, and from that time the course of criminal
justice in England has run substantially on the same lines, with
the single and temporary interruption caused by the court of
star chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span></p>

<p>The penal laws of modern states classify crimes somewhat
differently, but in the main on the same general principles,
dividing them into:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Offences against the external and internal
<span class="sidenote">Classification of crimes.</span>
order and security of the state.</p>

<p>2. Offences against the administration of police and
against public authority.</p>

<p>3. Acts injurious to the public in general.</p>

<p>4. Offences against the person (life, health, liberty and
reputation), and conjugal and parental rights and duties.</p>

<p>5. Offences relating to property and contracts (including
theft, fraud, forgery and malicious damage).</p>

<p>The terminology by which crimes are described by reference
to their comparative gravity varies considerably. In many
continental codes distinctions are drawn between crimes (Ger.
<i>Verbrechen</i>; Norse <i>vorbrydelser</i>; Span. <i>crimenes</i>; Ital.
<i>reato</i>), delicts (Ger. <i>Vergehen</i>; Ital. <i>delitti</i>; Span, <i>delitos</i>), and
contraventions (Ital. <i>contravenzioni</i>; Span, <i>faltas</i>).</p>

<p>The classification adopted by English law is peculiar to itself,
&ldquo;treason,&rdquo; &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour,&rdquo; with a tentative
fourth class described as &ldquo;summary offences.&rdquo; The particular
distinctions between these three classes are dealt with under the
titles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Treason</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Felony</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Misdemeanour</a></span>, &amp;c. Here it is
enough to say that the distinction is a result of history and is
marked for abolition and reclassification. Treason and most
felonies and some misdemeanours would under foreign codes
fall under the head of crime. Misdemeanour, roughly but not
exactly, corresponds to the French <i>délit</i>, and summary offence
to <i>contravention</i>.</p>

<p>In all systems of criminal law it is found necessary
to determine the criterion of criminal responsibility,
the mental elements of crime, the degrees of criminality
<span class="sidenote">Elements of criminal responsibility.</span>
and the point at which the line is to be drawn
between intention and commission.</p>

<p>The full definition of every crime contains expressly or by
implication a proposition as to a state of mind, and in all systems
of criminal law, competent age, sanity and some degree of
freedom from coercion, are assumed to be essential to criminality;
and it is also generally recognized that an act does not fall within
the sanction of the criminal law if done by pure accident or in an
honest and reasonable belief in circumstances which if true
would make it innocent; <i>e.g.</i> when a married person marries
again in the honest and reasonable but mistaken belief that the
former spouse is dead. Honest and reasonable mistake of fact
stands on the same footing as absence of the reasoning faculty,
as in infants, or perversion of that faculty, as in lunatics.</p>

<p>Besides the elements essential to constitute crime generally,
particular mental elements, which may differ widely, are involved
in the definition of particular crimes; and in the case of statutory
offences adequately and carefully defined, the mental elements
necessary to constitute the crime may be limited by the definition
so as to make the prohibition of the law against a particular act
absolute for all persons who are not infants or lunatics. As a
general rule of English law, it is enough to prove that the acts
alleged to constitute a crime were done by the accused, and to
leave him to rebut the presumption that he intended the natural
consequences of the acts by showing facts justifying or excusing
him or otherwise making him not liable. Children are conclusively
presumed to be incapable of crime up to seven years of
age; and from seven to fourteen the presumption is against the
capacity, but is not absolute.</p>

<p>Under the common law, insanity was an absolute answer to
an accusation of crime. Since 1883, where insanity is proved
to have existed at the date of the commission of the incriminated
acts, the accused is found guilty of the acts but insane when he
did them, and is relegated to a criminal lunatic asylum. There
was also at common law a presumption that a married woman
committing certain crimes in the presence of her husband did
so under his coercion. But under modern decisions and practice
the presumption has become feeble almost to inanition (<i>R</i>. v.
<i>Mary Baines</i>, 1900, 69 L.J. Q.B. 681). Distinctions are also
drawn between degrees of guilt or complicity.</p>

<p>English criminal law punishes attempts to commit crime if
the attempt passes from the stage of resolution or intention
to the stage of action, when the completion of the full offence
is frustrated by something other than the will of the accused.
Except in the case of attempt to commit murder, which is
a felony, attempts to commit a crime are punished as misdemeanours.
It also punishes the solicitation or incitement of
others to commit crime, as a separate offence if the incitement
fails, as the offence of being accessory before the fact or abettor
if the offence is committed as a result of the incitement; and
it punishes persons who, after a more serious crime&mdash;felony&mdash;has
been committed, do any act to shield the offender from
justice. In the case of the crimes described as felonies the law
distinguishes between principals in the first or second degree
and accessories before or after the fact. In the case of misdemeanours
the same punishment is incurred by the principal
offenders, and by persons who are present aiding and abetting the
commission of the offence, or who, though not present, counselled
or procured the commission of the offence (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Accessory</a></span>). Besides
these degrees of crime there is one almost peculiar to English
law known as conspiracy, <i>i.e.</i> an agreement to commit crime or to
do illegal acts (including interference with the due course of
justice), which is punishable even if the conspiracy does not get
beyond the stage of agreement. The exact nature of this form
of crime and the propriety of abolishing it or limiting its scope
have been the subject of much controversy, especially with
reference to combinations by trade unions.</p>

<p>The English law does not, but most European laws do, allow
the jury to reduce the penalty of an offence by finding in their
verdict that the commission of the offence was attended by
extenuating circumstances; but when the jury recommend
to mercy a person whom they find guilty the judge may give
effect to the recommendation or report it to the Home Office.</p>

<p>In systems of criminal law derived from England the forms of
crime or degrees of complicity above stated reappear with or
without modification, but as to conspiracy with a good deal of
alteration. In the Indian penal code, for instance, conspiracy
is limited to cases of treason (§ 121 A), and when it goes beyond
agreement in the case of other offences it is merely a form of
abetment or participation (§ 107).</p>

<p>The criminal law of England<a name="FnAnchor_1n" id="FnAnchor_1n" href="#Footnote_1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> is not codified, but is composed
of a large number of enactments resting on a basis of common
law. A very large part is reduced to writing in
statutes. The unwritten portion of the law includes
<span class="sidenote">Definitions of particular crimes.</span>
(1) principles relating to the excuse or justification of
acts or omissions which are prima facie criminal, (2)
the definitions of many offences, <i>e.g.</i> murder, assault, theft,
forgery, perjury, libel, riot, (3) parts of the law relating to
procedure. The law is very rich in principles and rules embodied
in judicial decisions and is extremely detailed and explicit,
leaving to the judges very little latitude of interpretation or
expression. So far as the legislature is concerned there is an
absence of systematic arrangement. The definitions of particular
crimes are still to be sought in the common law and the decisions
of the judges. The Consolidation Acts of 1861 for the most part
leave definitions as they stood, <i>e.g.</i> the Larceny Act 1861 does
not define the crime of larceny. The consequence is that exact
definitions are very difficult to frame, and the technical view of
a crime sometimes includes more, sometimes less, than it ought.
Thus the crime of murder, as settled by the existing law, would
include offences of such very different moral gravity as killing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
a man deliberately for the sake of robbing him, and killing a man
accidentally in an attempt to rob him. On the other hand,
offences which ought to have been criminal were constantly
declared by the judges not to fall within the definition of the
particular crimes alleged, and the legislature has constantly
had to fill up the <i>lacunae</i> in the law as interpreted by the judges.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction to deal with crime is primarily territorial,
and can be exercised only as to acts done within the territory
or territorial waters, or on the ships of the law-giver.
<i>Extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur.</i> No
<span class="sidenote">Jurisdiction.</span>
state will enforce the penal laws of another nor permit
the officer of another state to execute its laws outside its own
territory. But international law recognizes the competence of
a state to make its criminal law binding on its own subjects
wherever they are, and perhaps even to punish foreigners who
outside its territory do acts which menace its internal or external
security, <i>e.g.</i> by dynamite plots or falsification of coin. Apart
from extradition arrangements the national law cannot reach
such persons, be they citizens or aliens, until they come within
the territory of the state whose law has been broken.</p>

<p>The codes of France, Germany and Italy make the penal law
national or personal and not territorial. In some British colonies
whose legislatures have a derived and limited legislative
authority, indirect methods have been taken to deal within
the colony with persons who commit offences outside its
territory.</p>

<p>Throughout the development of the English criminal law it
showed and retains one particular characteristic that crime
was treated as local, which means not merely that the common
law of England was limited to English soil, but that an offence
on English soil could be &ldquo;inquired of, dealt with, tried, determined
and punished&rdquo; only in the particular territorial division
of England in which it was committed, which was and is known
as the venue (<i>q.v.</i>). Each township was responsible for crimes
within its boundaries, a responsibility made effective by the
&ldquo;view of frankpledge,&rdquo; now obsolete, and the guilt or innocence
of every man had to be determined by his neighbours. This
rule excluded from trial by the courts of common law, treasons,
&amp;c. committed by Englishmen abroad and piracy; and it was
not till Henry VIII.&rsquo;s reign (1536, 1544) that the common-law
mode of trial was extended to these offences. The legislature
has altered the common law as to numerous offences, but on no
settled plan, and except for a bill introduced about 1888, at the
instance of the 3rd marquess of Salisbury, no attempt has been
made to make the English criminal law apply generally to
subjects when outside the realm; and in view of the complicated
nature of the British empire and the absence of a common
criminal code it has been found desirable to remain content
with extradition in the case of crimes abroad, and with the
provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 in the case of
criminals who flee from one part to another of the empire.</p>

<p>The localization in England of crime, and the procedure for
punishing it, differ largely from the view taken in France and
most European countries. The French theory is that a Frenchman
owes allegiance to the French state, and commits a breach
of that allegiance whenever he commits a crime against French
law, even although he is not at the time within French territory.
In modern days this theory has been extended so as to allow
French and German courts to punish their subjects for crimes
committed in foreign countries, and by reason of this power
certain countries refuse to extradite their subjects who have
committed crimes in other states.</p>

<p>The principle of the French law, though not expressly recognized
in England, must be invoked to justify two departures
from the English principle&mdash;(1) as regards offences
on the high seas, and (2) as regards certain offences
<span class="sidenote">Offences on the high seas.</span>
committed outside the United Kingdom. In early
days offences committed by Englishmen on the high
seas were punished by the lord high admiral, and he encroached
so much on the ordinary courts as to render it necessary to pass
an act in Richard II.&rsquo;s reign (15 Rich. II. st. 2, c. 3) to restrain
him.</p>

<p>In the time of Henry VIII. (1536, 28 Hen. VIII. c. 15) an act
was passed stating that, as the admiral tried persons according
to the course of civil law, they could not be convicted unless
either they confessed or they or the witnesses were submitted
to torture, and that therefore it was expedient to try the offences
according to the course of the common law. Under that act
a special commission of oyer and terminer was issued to try these
offences at the Old Bailey, and English law was satisfied by permitting
the indictment to state that the offence was committed
on board a ship on the high seas, to wit in the county of Middlesex.
Since 1861 these special commissions have been rendered unnecessary
by the provision (contained in each of the Criminal Law
Consolidation Acts of that year) that all offences committed on
the high seas may be tried as if they had been committed in
England. As regards offences on land, it was found necessary
as early as the reign of Henry VIII. (1544) to provide for the trial
in England of treasons and murders committed on land outside
England. This was largely due to the constant presence in
<span class="sidenote">Offences committed on land outside England.</span>
France of the king and many of his nobles and knights,
but the aid of this statute had to be invoked in 1903
in the case of Lynch, tried for treason in South Africa.
The latest legislation on the subject was in 1861
(Offences against the Person Act, § 9), and any murder
or manslaughter committed on land out of the United Kingdom,
whether within the king&rsquo;s dominions or without, and whether
the person killed were a subject of His Majesty or not, may be
dealt with in all respects as if it were committed in England.
The jurisdiction has been extended to a few other cases such as
slave trade, bigamy, perjury, committed with reference to
proceedings in an English court, and offences connected with
explosives. But these offences must be committed on land and
not on board a foreign ship, because if a man takes service on
board a foreign ship he is treated for the time as being a member
of the foreign state to which that ship belongs. The principle
<span class="sidenote">Misdemeanours committed by public officers in colonies.</span>
has been also extended to misdemeanours (but not to
felonies) committed by public officers out of Great
Britain, whether within or without the British
dominions. Thus a governor or an inferior officer of a
colony, if appointed by the British government, may be
prosecuted for any misdemeanour committed by him by
virtue of his office in the colony; and cases have occurred where
governors have been so prosecuted, such as that of General
Picton at the beginning of the 19th century, and of Governor
Eyre of Jamaica in 1865, and the attempt to prosecute Governor
MacCallum of Natal in 1906. As a corollary to the system of
&ldquo;capitulations&rdquo; applied to certain non-Christian states in Asia
and Africa, it has been necessary to take powers for punishing
under English law offences by British subjects in those states,
which would otherwise go unpunished either by the law of the
land where the offence was committed or by the law of the state
to which the offender belonged (Jenkyns, <i>Foreign Jurisdiction
of the Crown</i>).</p>

<p>An essential part of the criminal law is the punishment or
sanction by which the state seeks to prevent or avenge offences.
See also under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Criminology</a></span>. Here it is enough
<span class="sidenote">Punishment.</span>
to say that during the 19th century great changes
have been made throughout the world in the modes
of punishing crime.</p>

<p>In England until early in the 19th century, punishments for
crime were ferocious. The severity of the law was tempered
by the rule as to benefit of clergy and by the rigid adherence of
the judges (<i>in favorem vitae</i>) to the rules of correct pleading and
proof, whereby the slightest error on the part of the prosecution
led to an acquittal. Bentham pointed out that certainty of
punishment was more effective than severity, that severe
punishments induced juries to acquit criminals, and that thus
the certainty of punishment was diminished. But his arguments
and the eloquence of Sir Samuel Romilly produced no effect
until after the reform of parliament in 1832, shortly after which
statutes were passed abolishing the death sentence for all felonies
where benefit of clergy existed. The severity of capital sentences
had already been modified by the pardoning power of the crown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
which pardoned convicts under sentence of death on their
consenting to be transported to convict settlements in the colonies.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Deportation</a></span>.) For some years this was only done by the
consent of the convict, who agreed to be transported if his death
sentence was remitted, but in 1824, when a convict refused to
give this consent, parliament authorized the crown to substitute
transportation for a death sentence, and the same course was
adopted in Ireland in 1851 when some treason-felony prisoners
refused commutation of their sentence to transportation.</p>

<p>The punishments now in use under the English law for indictable
offences are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Death, inflicted by hanging, with a provision that other
modes of execution may be authorized by royal warrant in cases
of high treason.</p>

<p>2. Penal servitude, which in 1853 was substituted for transportation
to penal settlements outside the United Kingdom.
The minimum term of penal servitude is three years (Penal
Servitude Act 1891), and the sentence is carried out in a convict
prison, in the United Kingdom, but there is still power to send
the convicts out of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>3. Imprisonment in a local prison, which must be without hard
labour unless a statute specially authorizes a sentence of hard
labour. At common law there is no limit to a term of imprisonment
for misdemeanour; but for many offences (both felonies
and misdemeanours) the term is limited by statute to two years,
and in practice this limit is not exceeded for any offence. The
treatment of prisoners is regulated by the prison acts and rules.</p>

<p>4. Police supervision, on conviction or indictment of felony
and certain misdemeanours after a previous conviction of such
offences. Prevention of Crimes Act, c. 112, §§ 8, 20.</p>

<p>5. Pecuniary fine, a punishment appropriate only to misdemeanours
and never imposed for a felony except under
statutory authority, <i>e.g.</i> manslaughter (Offences against the
Person Act, § 5). The amount of the fine is in the discretion of
the judge, subject to the directions of Magna Carta and the
Bill of Rights and of any statute limiting the maximum for a
particular offence.</p>

<p>6. Whipping was a common law punishment for misdemeanants
of either sex. Under the present law the whipping of females
is prohibited, and the punishment is not inflicted on males except
under statutory authority, which is given in the case of certain
assaults on the sovereign, of certain forms of robbery with
violence or assaults with intent to commit felony (Garrotters
Act 1863), of incorrigible rogues, larceny and malicious damage,
and certain other offences by youthful offenders.</p>

<p>7. Recognizances (caution) to keep peace and be of good
behaviour, <i>i.e.</i> a bond with or without sureties creating a debt
to the crown not enforceable unless the conditions as to conduct
therein made are broken. This bond may be taken from any
misdemeanant, and, under statutory authority, from persons
convicted of any felony (except murder) falling within the
Criminal Law Consolidation Acts of 1861.</p>

<p>8. In the case of any offence which is not capital the court,
if it is a first offence or if any other grounds for mercy appear,
may simply bind the offender over to come up for judgment
when required, intimating to him that if his conduct is good no
further steps will be taken to punish him.</p>

<p>Except in the case of the death penalty, the court of trial
has a discretion as to the <i>quantum</i> of a particular punishment,
no minimum being fixed. In the case of offences punishable
on summary conviction the maximum punishment is always
fixed by statute. It consists of imprisonment with or without
hard labour, or a fine of a limited amount, or both. The imprisonment
in very few cases may exceed six months. If the maximum
exceeds three months the accused must be informed that he has a
right, if he so elects, to be tried by a jury.</p>

<p>Where power is given to deal summarily with offences which
under ordinary circumstances would be tried on indictment,
the punishments are as follows (Summary Jurisdiction Act
1879):&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) In the case of adults pleading guilty, imprisonment not
exceeding six months without the option of a fine.</p>

<p>(b) In the case of adults (consenting to be summarily tried),
where the offence affects property not worth over forty shillings,
imprisonment not over three months, or fine not exceeding £20.</p>

<p>(c) In the case of young persons, between twelve and sixteen
years, imprisonment not over three months, or fine not exceeding
£10.</p>

<p>(d) In the case of children under twelve, imprisonment not
over one month, or fine not exceeding forty shillings.</p>

<p>If the offence is trifling, the accused may be discharged
without punishment, and under the First Offenders Act (1887)
the justices have a discretionary power to forgo punishment.
The justices have also the power, under the Prevention of Crime
Act 1908, in lieu of passing a sentence of penal servitude or
imprisonment, to commit persons between the ages of sixteen and
twenty-one to a Borstal institution, for a period of detention
ranging from one to three years (see <span class="sc">Juvenile Offenders</span>).</p>

<p>In the criminal law of Europe the scale of punishments is
on similar lines in most states, and is more elaborate than that
of England, and less is left to the discretion of the court of trial.
The following examples will indicate the kind of punishments
awarded under the French penal code. Punishments are
classified as (1) <i>afflictives et infamantes</i>, including death, <i>travaux
forcés à perpétuité ou à temps</i>, <i>déportation</i>, <i>détention</i>, <i>reclusion</i>;
(2) <i>infamantes</i>, viz. banishment and civil degradation; (3)
<i>peines en matière correctionnelle</i>, viz. imprisonment in a house
of correction (six days to five years), interdiction from certain
civic rights, and fine. The punishments in no case have any
effect to extinguish the civil claims of individuals who have
suffered by the offence (arts. 6 and 55). Special provisions are
made for <i>récidivistes</i>, police supervision and first offenders (<i>Loi
Bérenger</i>).</p>

<p>In the German code of 1872 the legal punishments are: (1)
death; (2) penal servitude for life or for a term not exceeding
fifteen years nor less than one year; (3) imprisonment with
labour for a term not exceeding five years nor less than one day;
(4) confinement in a fortress (terms same as for penal servitude
but involving only withdrawal of freedom and supervision); (5)
arrest for not more than six weeks nor less than one day; (6)
fine (not less than three marks in the case of crimes or delicts
nor one mark in case of petty offences). Sentence of imprisonment
is in certain cases followed by liability to be placed under
police supervision for a term after release. In the case of a
sentence of death or of penal servitude, the court may order
forfeiture of civil privileges, and a condemnation to penal
servitude permanently disqualifies for service in the army and
public office (Code pt. 1, chap. 1, arts. 13-40).</p>

<p>Under the Italian code of 1889 (arts. 11-30) the punishments
are (1) <i>ergastolo</i> (for life); (2) <i>reclusione</i> (from three days to
twenty-four years), which involves hard labour and cellular
confinement; (3) <i>detenzione</i> (like term), which involves labour
and at night separate confinement; (4) <i>confino</i> (one month to
three years), a form of banishment from the commune of origin
or residence of the offender; (5a) fine (<i>multa</i>), from ten to ten
thousand lire; (5b) <i>amende</i>, from one to two thousand lire; (6)
arrest (one day to two years); (7) interdiction from public
office; (8) suspension from professional calling. Punishments
(5b), (6) and (8) are applied only to contraventions, the others
to crimes (<i>delitti</i>).</p>

<p>The Spanish law (<i>Codigo Penal</i>, title 3, chaps. 2 and 3) contains
a general scale of punishments classified as afflictive, correctional,
light and accessory. The first class begins with death and runs
down through many forms of imprisonment to disqualification
(<i>inhabilitacion</i>). The second includes forms of imprisonment,
(<i>presidio</i> and <i>prisión</i>), and arrest, public censure and suspension
from the exercise of certain offices or callings. The slight
punishments are minor arrest and private censure. Offenders
in any of the three classes may also be fined or put under recognizance
(<i>caución</i>). The accessory punishments include payment
of costs, degradation, civil interdiction.</p>

<p>In England indictable offences (<i>i.e.</i> offences which must be
tried by a judge and jury) are thus dealt with:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Courts of assize (sitting under old commissions known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
commissions of assize, oyer and terminer, and general gaol
delivery) are held twice or oftener in every year in each county
<span class="sidenote">Tribunals.</span>
and also in some large cities and boroughs. They are
the lineal successors of the justices <i>in eyre</i><a name="FnAnchor_2n" id="FnAnchor_2n" href="#Footnote_2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> of the
middle ages; but they are now integral parts of the High Court
of Justice. These courts can try any indictable offence presented
by a grand jury for the district in which they sit.</p>

<p>2. For the counties of London and Middlesex and certain
adjoining districts, a special court of assize known as the central
criminal court sits monthly.</p>

<p>3. In all counties and many boroughs the justices of the
peace sit quarterly or oftener under the commission of the peace
to try the minor indictable offences. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quarter Sessions,
Court of</a></span>.)</p>

<p>4. The High Court of Justice in the king&rsquo;s bench division
tries a few special offences in its original jurisdiction, and where
justice requires may transfer indictments from other courts
for trial before itself.</p>

<p>5. The court of criminal appeal has been instituted by the
Criminal Appeal Act 1907; to it all persons convicted on
indictment have a right of appeal. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Appeal</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The substantive law as to crime applies in England to all
persons except the reigning sovereign, and criminal procedure
is the same for all subjects alike, except in the case of peers or
peeresses charged with felony, who have the right of trial by
their peers in the House of Lords if it be sitting, or in the court
of the lord high steward.</p>

<p>There are in England no courts of a special character, such
as exist in some foreign countries, for the determination of
disputes between the governing classes themselves
or with the governed classes, whether of a civil or
<span class="sidenote">Special tribunals.</span>
criminal character. There are a few exceptional
courts with criminal jurisdiction. The court of chivalry, which
used to punish offences committed within military lines outside
the kingdom, is obsolete. Special tribunals exist for trying
naval or military offences committed by members of the navy
and army, but those members are not exempt from being tried
by the ordinary tribunals for offences against the ordinary law,
as though they were civilians. The naval courts can be held
only on board a ship, and can as a general rule try only persons
entered on the books of a king&rsquo;s ship. The military courts can
only try persons who are actually members of the army at the
time, and their authority is annually renewed by parliament,
in consequence of the jealousy still felt against the trial of any
man except by the ordinary courts of law. Military and naval
courts can try in any part of the world, and whenever the forces are
in active service can try followers of the camp as if they were
actual members of the forces. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Military Law</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Martial
Law</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical courts, which were formerly very powerful
in England, and punished persons for various offences, such as
perjury, swearing, and sexual offences, have now
almost fallen into disuse. Their authority over
<span class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical courts.</span>
Protestant dissenters from the established church
was taken away by statute; their authority over lay
members of the Church of England has disappeared by disuse.
Occasionally suits are instituted in them against the clergy for
offences either against morality or against doctrine or ritual.
In these cases their sentences are enforced by penalties, such as
suspension, or deprivation of benefice, or by imprisonment;
which has replaced the old punishment of excommunication.</p>

<p>A system of procedure, with the judicial machinery required
to work it, may be created either by the direct legislative action
of the supreme power or by custom and the action
of the courts. Both at Rome and in England it was
<span class="sidenote">Procedure.</span>
through usage and by the courts themselves that
the earlier system was slowly moulded: both at Rome and in
England it was direct legislation that established the later
system. (See Bryce, <i>Studies in History and Jurisprudence</i>, 1901,
ii. 334.)</p>

<p>The characteristics of English criminal procedure which most
distinguish it from the procedure of other countries are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It is litigious or accusatory and not inquisitorial (Stephen,
<i>Prel. View Cr. Law</i>). It is for the prosecutor to prove by evidence
the commission of the alleged offence. No power exists to
interrogate the accused unless he consents to be sworn as a
witness in his own defence, which since 1898 he may do. The
right to cross-examine him even when he is so sworn is limited
by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his past
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular
charge on which he is being tried.</p>

<p>2. The forms of criminal pleading still in use are in substance
framed on the lines of the old system of pleading at common
law in civil cases, which was swept away by the judicature acts.
Criminal pleadings have, however, one peculiarity. Indictments,
being in form the presentment of a grand jury, could not be
amended until provision for that purpose was made in 1851.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indictment</a></span>.)</p>

<p>3. Criminal prosecutions are ordinarily undertaken by the
individuals who have suffered by a crime. There is not in
England, as in Scotland and all European countries, a public
department concerned to deal with all prosecutions for crime.
The result is that the prosecution of most ordinary crime is left
to individual enterprise or the action of the local police force or
the justices&rsquo; clerk.</p>

<p>The attorney-general has always represented the crown in
criminal matters, and in state prosecutions appears in person
on behalf of the crown, and when he so appears has certain
privileges as respects the reply to the prisoner&rsquo;s defence and
the mode of trial. In the Prosecution of Offences Acts of 1879,
1884 and 1908 there is to be found the nucleus of a system of
public prosecution such as obtains in other countries in case of
crime. Under these acts the director of public prosecutions (up
to 1908 an office conjoint with that of solicitor to the Treasury)
acts under the attorney-general, but unless specially directed he
only undertakes a limited number of prosecutions, <i>e.g.</i> for murder,
coining and serious crimes affecting the government.</p>

<p>4. Where an indictable offence is supposed to have been
committed the accused is arrested, with or without the warrant
of a justice, according to the nature of the offence, or is summoned
by a justice before him. On his appearance a preliminary
inquiry is held for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is
a prima facie case against him. The procedure is regulated by
the Indictable Offences Act 1848, and is entirely different from
the procedure for summary offences. It may be, though usually
it is not, held in private; it is an inquiry and not a trial; the
justices have to consider not whether the man is guilty, but
whether there is such a prima facie case against him that he
ought to be tried. If they think that there is, they commit him
to prison to wait his trial, or require him to give security, with
or without sureties, to the amount named by them, for appearing
to take his trial. If they think the charge unsubstantial they
discharge the accused at once. The prosecutor in cases of felony
may if he likes go before the grand jury whether the case has
or has not been the subject of a preliminary inquiry, but in the
case of many misdemeanours it is obligatory first to have a
preliminary inquiry, as a protection against vexatious indictments.</p>

<p>Whether there has or has not been a preliminary inquiry
before a magistrate, no person can be tried for any of the graver
crimes, treason or felony, except upon indictment
found by a grand jury of the county or place where
<span class="sidenote">The grand jury.</span>
the offence is said to have been committed or is by
statute made cognizable. In olden days, and even now in theory,
the grand jury inquire of their own knowledge, by the oath of
good and lawful men of the neighbourhood, into the crime of
the county, but in practice the charges against the accused
persons are always first submitted to the proper officer of the
court. The grand jurors are instructed as to their inquisition
by a charge from the judge, as regards the indictments concerning
which they are called upon to enquire whether there is a
prima facie case to send them for trial to the petty jury. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
grand jury must consist of not less than twelve, nor more than
twenty-three, good and lawful men of the county. But any
person who prefers an indictment is entitled to have it presented
to the grand jury. Officers of the court lay the indictments before
the grand jury. The charges are then called bills, and if the
grand jury considers that there is no prima facie case the foreman
endorses the bill with the words &ldquo;no true bill,&rdquo; and it is then
presented to the judge. The jury are then said to have ignored
the bill, and if the person charged is in custody he is released,
but is liable to be indicted again on better evidence.</p>

<p>As a means of constitutional protection in times of monarchical
aggression this practice had no doubt a great value, but in the
present day, when few offenders are tried without a preliminary
inquiry by justices, the functions of a grand jury are of secondary
importance, and the jurors&rsquo; time is perhaps needlessly occupied.
The institution of the grand jury prevented the crown in the
days of its great power from removing a person whom it wished
to get rid of from among his neighbours, and placing him on trial
in a strange place where the influence of the crown was greater.
This is still true to a certain extent, as great injustice may be
caused to a man by removing him from his neighbours and
trying him at a distance from his friends, and from the witnesses
whom he might call for his defence. In Ireland, for instance,
the greatest injustice might be done by removing an Orangeman
from Belfast and trying him in a Roman Catholic county or
vice versa. But it has its evils where the area from which the
jurors are drawn is small, such as a town of a few thousand
inhabitants. In that case a man charged, say, with fraud, may
be protected by his friends from being properly punished for
that fraud. But where justice requires, an order may be made
for the trial of the offence in another county or at the central
criminal court.</p>

<p>In many colonies the Scottish system has been adopted,
by which the ordinary form of accusation is by indictment
framed by the public prosecutor, and a grand jury is only impannelled
in cases where an individual claims to prosecute an
offence as to which the public officials decline to proceed. In
England criminal informations by the attorney-general, or by
leave of the court without the intervention of a grand jury, are
permitted in cases of misdemeanour, but are now rarely preferred.</p>

<p>If a coroner&rsquo;s jury, on inquiring into any sudden death, finds
that murder or manslaughter has been committed, that finding
has the same effect as an indictment by a grand jury,
and the man charged may be tried by the petty jury
<span class="sidenote">Coroner&rsquo;s courts.</span>
accordingly. The law and procedure of the coroner&rsquo;s
courts are now regulated by the Coroners Act 1887. When
there is a dead body of a person lying within the area of his
jurisdiction, and there is reasonable cause to suspect that such
person died a violent or unnatural death, or a sudden death of
which the cause is unknown, or has died in prison, the coroner
is entitled to hold an inquest, and if the verdict or inquisition
finds murder or manslaughter, it is followed by trial in the same
way as if the person accused had been indicted.</p>

<p>When an indictment is found by the grand jury (twelve at
least must concur) the person charged is brought before the
court, the indictment is read to him, he is asked
whether he is guilty or not guilty. If he pleads guilty
<span class="sidenote">Trial by jury.</span>
he is then sentenced by the court; if he pleads not
guilty, a petty jury of twelve is formed from the panel or list of
jurors who have been summoned by the sheriff to attend the
court. He is tried by these jurors in open court. The common
law method of trial of crimes by a jury of twelve, native to
English law, has been in modern times transplanted to European
countries. It was not the original form of trial, for it was preceded
by wager of battle (which was not finally abolished
till 1819); and by ordeal, which was suppressed as to criminal
trials in 1219 in consequence of the decree of the Lateran Council
(1216). The first was allowed only on an appeal by an individual
accuser; the second was resorted to on an accusation by public
fame, which the accused was allowed to meet by submitting to the
ordeal. It was after 1219 that trial by the jury of twelve (known
as trial in pais) began to develop. At the outset the accused
used to be asked how he would be tried, and could not be directly
compelled to plead to the charge or to accept trial by a jury;
which led to the indirect pressure known as the <i>peine forte et dure</i>,
which fell into disuse after the Revolution and was formally
abolished in 1772. But it was not until 1827 that refusal to
plead was treated as a plea of not guilty, entailing a trial by a
jury, and some old-fashioned officials still ask the old question
&ldquo;How will you be tried?&rdquo; to which the old answer was &ldquo;By
God and my country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The original trial jury or inquest certainly acted on its own
knowledge or inquiries without necessarily having evidence laid
before it in court. The impartiality of the jurors was to some
extent secured by the power of challenge. The exact time when
the jury came into its present position is difficult accurately to
define. On the trial before the petty jury the procedure and the
rules of evidence differ in very few points from an ordinary civil
case. The proceedings as already stated are accusatory. The
prosecutor must begin to prove his case. Confessions (which are
the object sought by French procedure) are regarded with some
suspicion, and admissions alleged to have been made by the
accused are not admitted unless it is clear that they were not
extracted by inducements of a temporal nature held out by persons
in authority over him. During the spring assizes of 1877 a
prisoner was charged with having committed a murder twenty
years before, and the counsel for the prosecution, with the consent
of the judge, withdrew from the case because the only evidence,
besides the prisoner&rsquo;s own confession, was that of persons who
either had never known him personally or could not identify
him. The accused may not be interrogated by the judge or the
prosecuting counsel unless he consents to be sworn as a witness.
In this respect the contrast between a criminal trial in England
and a criminal trial in France is very striking. The interrogation
and browbeating of the prisoner by the judge, consistent as it
may be with the inquisitorial theory of their procedure, is strange
to English lawyers, accustomed to see in every criminal trial a
fair fight between the prisoner and the prosecution, and not a
contest between the judge and the prisoner. The accused may,
if he choose, be defended by counsel, and if poor may get legal
aid at the public expense if the court certify for it. He is entitled
to cross-examine the witnesses for the prosecution and to call
witnesses in his defence. At the conclusion of the evidence
and speeches the judge sums up to the jury both as to the facts
and the law, and the jury by their verdict acquit or convict.
Immediate discharge follows on acquittal; sentence by the
judge on conviction.</p>

<p>Justices of the peace may under many statutes convict in
a summary manner (without the intervention of a jury) for
offences of minor importance. The procedure for
punishing summary offences is before two justices,
<span class="sidenote">Summary trials.</span>
or a stipendiary magistrate. This proceeding must not
be confused with the preliminary inquiry already mentioned
before justices for an indictable offence, nor with the procedure
before justices in relation to civil matters, such as the recovery
of small sums of money. The proceeding begins either by the
issue of a warrant for the arrest of the person charged, in which
case a sworn information must be filed, or by a summons directing
the person charged to appear on a certain day to answer the
complaint made by the prosecutor. The justices hear the case
in open court; the person charged can make his defence either in
person or by his solicitor or counsel, he can cross-examine
<span class="sidenote">Procedure for summary offences.</span>
the witnesses for the prosecution, call his own witnesses,
and address the justices in his defence. The
justices, after hearing the case, either acquit or convict
him, and in case of conviction award the sentence.
If the sentence is a fine, and the fine is not paid, the person convicted
is liable to be imprisoned for the term fixed by the justices,
not exceeding a scale fixed by an act of 1879, the maximum of
which is one month. The imprisonment may be with or without
hard labour.</p>

<p>Of late years this summary jurisdiction of the justices has
received very large extensions, and many offences which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
formerly prosecuted as serious offences by an indictment before
the court of assize or quarter sessions have, where the offence was
a trivial one, been made punishable, on summary proceedings
before justices, by a small fine or a short term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The extension of the jurisdiction of the justices is open to the
observation that it deprives a person charged of the protection
of a jury, and also that it throws upon him, if convicted, and upon
the prosecution if there is no conviction, the cost of the proceedings.
The former objection is much mitigated by the enactment
made in 1879, that a person if liable on conviction to be sentenced
to imprisonment for more than three months, or to a fine exceeding
£100, can claim to be tried by a jury. But the objection as
to the costs remains, and the payment of costs is often a very
serious addition to the trivial fine; and it is anomalous that a
person convicted of a trifling offence should bear the cost of the
prosecution, while if he is convicted before a superior tribunal of
the most serious offence he does not pay the costs.</p>

<p>In English law until 1907, where a criminal case had been tried
by a jury the verdict of the jury of guilt or innocence was final
and there was no appeal on the facts. Any considerable
defect or informality in the procedure might be the
<span class="sidenote">Appeal.</span>
subject of a writ of error. And if any question of law arose at
the trial, the judge might, if he chose, reserve it for the opinion
of the court for the consideration of crown cases reserved, by
whom the conviction might be either quashed or confirmed.</p>

<p>By the Criminal Appeal Act 1907, a new court was established,
to which any person convicted on indictment might appeal.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Appeal</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The expenses of prosecution for crime in England are dealt
with in the following manner. Prosecutions for high treason
and the cognate offence known as treason-felony
are at the expense of the state, which alone undertakes
<span class="sidenote">Costs.</span>
such prosecutions. In the case of all other felonies and of many
misdemeanours the expense of the prosecution falls on the local
rate. In the case of other misdemeanours the expense falls on
the prosecutor. Where an offence is summarily prosecuted the
costs are in the discretion of the court, which may order the
accused to pay them, if convicted, or the prosecutor to pay on
acquittal, or may leave the parties to pay their own expenses.
On charges of felony and a few misdemeanours the court may
order the accused person to pay the expenses of his prosecution
in relief of the local rate. In a few cases, chiefly where the
prosecution is vexatious, the court may order the prosecution
to pay the expenses of the defence. The expenses of witnesses
for the defence in any indictable offence may be paid out of the
local rate when they have been called at the preliminary inquiry;
and where the court in the case of a poor prisoner has certified
that he should have legal aid, the expenses of the defence may
be charged to the local rate. The local rate upon which the
expenses fall is usually that of the county or borough in which
the offence was committed; but sometimes is that of the place
where the offence is tried.</p>

<p>Between 1852 and 1888 parliament reimbursed to the local
authorities the expense imposed on the local rate. In 1888 the
proceeds of certain taxes were set aside and handed over to the
local authorities as a set-off to the expense incurred in prosecutions.
In one class of case, offences committed in the admiralty
jurisdiction, <i>i.e.</i> outside England, the treasury directly reimburses
to the local authorities the expense incurred.</p>

<p>Under most, if not all, European codes, the state pays for
the prosecution, subject to reimbursement by the accused, if
the court so orders.</p>

<p>The English system of criminal procedure is the basis of that
of most of the states which form the United States of America,
and, with few exceptions, of the procedure throughout
<span class="sidenote">Non-British criminal procedure.</span>
the British empire.</p>

<p>The French penal code and code of criminal
procedure are substantially the model of all systems
of continental criminal law. They were promulgated in 1811
by Napoleon I., and although he called in the aid of the greatest
French jurists, he guided, and occasionally even revised, their
labours. The French codes have been improved upon by later
European codes, and more especially by the Italian penal code.
All European codes have an opening chapter where the general
principles of criminal law in its practical application are enunciated,
such as, for instance, the rules that&mdash;(1) no person is liable
to punishment for any act not expressly declared to be an
offence; (2) no person can be punished for an act which by
virtue of a subsequent law is declared not to be an offence;
(3) whoever commits an offence within the kingdom is tried and
punished according to the criminal law of the kingdom, and by
the tribunals created for the administration of justice, to the
exclusion of special tribunals created for temporary purposes.
This rule really lays down that no citizen can be deprived of
his own judges when he is accused of a criminal offence. (4)
A citizen, although he may have been tried in a foreign country
for an offence committed within the kingdom, can be retried
according to the law of the kingdom. (5) Extradition only
applies to foreigners, not to citizens. The preliminary chapter
is followed by the classification of offences according to the
importance of the punishments the law assigns to them. The
lowest degree of offence is denominated &ldquo;contravention.&rdquo; It
applies mainly to the pettiest offences, or to infractions of police
regulations, and can be punished by fine or by imprisonment
under a week, or by both fine and imprisonment, limited to a
week. Next comes the &ldquo;<i>délit</i>,&rdquo; which includes all offences
punished by imprisonment over a week and under five years.
Then, finally, we arrive at the &ldquo;<i>crime</i>,&rdquo; the highest form of
offence in French criminal law. It includes all offences subject
to a more severe sentence than the punishment assigned to a
<i>délit</i>. All cases are held to be crimes where death, life-imprisonment
with or without hard labour, deportation out of the kingdom,
detention or seclusion in a fortress or other expressly
assigned place, are the punishments mentioned by the law. A
certain number of explanatory definitions follow, of which the
most important concern <i>attempts</i> to commit offences, and in
&ldquo;crimes&rdquo; they are punishable if the execution of the attempt
was only prevented by circumstances beyond the will of the
offender, whilst in &ldquo;<i>délits</i>&rdquo; an attempt is not punishable as an
offence unless the law specially provides that it should be
punished. As regards &ldquo;contraventions,&rdquo; attempts not carried
out are not held to be offences at all. Accomplices are generally
subject to the same punishment as the principal. Old offenders
(<i>récidivistes</i>) are subject to severer punishments. The usual
exceptions as regards responsibility for crime, such as madness
and extreme youth and <i>force majeure</i>, are to be found in all
codes. The excuse of youth extends to all offenders under the
age of sixteen, when the tribunal decides whether the offender
has acted without &ldquo;discernment,&rdquo; and acquits where the discernment
is not found, whilst one-half of the usual punishment
is inflicted where discernment is found. Foreign codes differ
from the English law in allowing the injured party to claim
damages in the criminal suit, appearing as <i>partie civile</i>. On
another question there is a wide divergence on the continent
of Europe from English law. According to the law of England
there is no prescription in criminal law (with a few exceptions
created by statute). An offender is always liable to punishment
whatever time may have elapsed since the committal of the
offence. On the continent of Europe the limitation of a judgment
and sentence for a crime is twenty years; five years for
a <i>délit</i>, and for a contravention two years. No proceedings can
be taken as regards a crime after a lapse of ten years, whilst as
regards a <i>délit</i> the limit is three years, and two years for a
contravention.</p>

<p>There are three main differences between English criminal
procedure and European criminal procedure.</p>

<p>1. A criminal prosecution directed on European criminal
procedure at once passes into the hands of the state as an infringement
of law which must be repressed, on the ground that the
whole community bases its security on obedience to law. In
England the repression of all minor crime is left to the injured
party.</p>

<p>2. In England every criminal trial from beginning to end is,
and has always been, public. Preliminary inquiries into an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
indictable offence may be, but rarely if ever are, conducted
in private. On the continent of Europe, with rare exceptions,
all preliminary proceedings in a criminal charge are secret.
Outside English-speaking countries this secret investigation
continues more or less. But of the two systems, accusatory
or inquisitorial&mdash;the first meaning the right of the accused to
defend himself, the second meaning the right of the state to
examine any legal offence in private in order to ensure the safety
of society,&mdash;the accusatory is gaining ground in every country.
In English-speaking countries it is an established law that an
accused person should have the right of publicity of the proceedings
and the right to defend himself by counsel and by
witnesses. In Europe the inquisitorial system is gradually being
abandoned. Perhaps the best code of criminal procedure in
Europe is that promulgated in Austria in 1873. It followed a
fundamental law of the Empire which laid down <i>inter alia</i> that
all legal proceedings, civil or criminal, should be oral and public,
and that the accusatory system in criminal cases should be
adopted. Germany followed this example. Italy, Holland.
Switzerland and Spain have followed Austria and Germany as
regards the preliminary investigation; Italy and Belgium have
surrounded the accused with guarantees against arbitrary
confinement before trial; Holland has conferred upon the accused
the right of seeing the adverse testimony and of being confronted
with the witnesses, and, further, has formally insisted that no
insidious questions, such as questions assuming a fact as true
which is not known to be true, should be allowed. Other
countries still remain on the old lines. But everywhere, whether
reform has actually been accomplished or not, there is a demand
for even-handed justice, and a growing conviction that the
accused should have all his rights, now that society is no longer
in danger from undiscovered criminals and unpunished crime.
Even in France, the champion of the inquisitorial system, a
change is being made. Up to 1897 secrecy was imposed invariably
in the preliminary investigation of crime, and was held
necessary for the discovery and punishment of the offender.
The <i>Loi de l&rsquo;instruction contradictoire</i>, December 8, 1897,
however, was a long step towards complete justice in the treatment
of the accused in the preliminary inquiry. The main
reform is that the accused, after he has once appeared before
the judge and a formal charge has been made against him, is
entitled to the assistance of counsel, either chosen by himself or
assigned to him if he is poor. If he is in prison he is allowed
to communicate freely with his counsel, who is entitled to see all
the proceedings, and in every appearance before the judge his
counsel accompanies him. There are, however, certain limitations.
The counsel cannot address the judge without leave,
which may be refused, nor can he insist on any proceeding he
thinks necessary in his client&rsquo;s interest. He can only solicit.
He has no right to be present at the examination of witnesses,
who continue to be interrogated by the judge alone and not in
the presence of the accused; but he must receive twenty-four
hours&rsquo; notice of every appearance of the accused, and he is
entitled to be present whenever his client, after the first formal
appearance, comes before the judge. In England, as already
pointed out, although the prosecution is in the name of the crown,
and although a public prosecutor has been appointed, still as
a rule it is conducted by the person injured as the person injured,
or by the police.</p>

<p>3. In England the single-judge system is universal, save in
appeal; on the continent of Europe plurality of judges is insisted
upon, save in the most trivial cases, where the punishment is
insignificant. In most countries of the continent of Europe
the whole machinery for the prevention, investigation and
punishment of crime, is conducted by what is called the <i>parquet</i>,
which represents society as a collective unit and not the individual
injured. The head of the whole parquet in France is the <i>procureur-général</i>,
who holds equal rank with the members of the supreme
court. Under him there are procureurs-généraux attached to
each of the courts of appeal, of which in France there are twenty-six,
and under each of these subordinate procureurs there are
procureurs (prosecutors) of a lesser degree. The next stage
to the parquet is the <i>juge d&rsquo;instruction</i>, who corresponds to the
English magistrate, and is the most formidable personage in the
whole system of French criminal law. He can detain and
accuse a person in prison, can send for him at any time and ask
him such questions as he pleases.</p>

<p>After the first examination the prisoner is entitled, in most
European countries, to the assistance of counsel, but the powers
of counsel are so limited that the juge d&rsquo;instruction has a complete
discretionary power regarding the investigation of the case.
The natural consequence of this procedure is that the preliminary
investigation really decides the ultimate result, and the final
trial becomes more or less a solemn form.</p>

<p>The criminal law of Ireland is to a great extent the same as
that of England, resting on the same common law and on statutes
which extend to both countries or are in almost the
same terms, and is administered by courts of assize
<span class="sidenote">Ireland.</span>
and quarter sessions, and by justices, as in England. In a few
instances statutes passed for England or Great Britain before
the Union have not been extended to Ireland, or statutes passed
by the Irish parliament before the Union or by the British parliament
since the Union create offences not known to English law.
In Ireland the system of prosecution is nominally the same as
in England, but in practice almost all prosecutions are instituted
and conducted under the direction of the attorney-general for
Ireland, who is a member of the government of the day, and so
responsible to parliament, as in the case of the lord advocate.
In Ireland, owing to the police being a centralized force, under the
management of commissioners residing in Dublin, any prosecution
which in England might be conducted by the local police,
would in Ireland be conducted under the direction of the chief
of the police in Dublin, who is necessarily in close communication
with and under the control of the attorney-general.</p>

<p>In Scotland hardly any crimes are constituted by statute
law, the common law being to the effect that if a judge will
direct any act to be a crime, and a jury will convict,
that act is a crime. This great elasticity of the common
<span class="sidenote">Scotland.</span>
law to include every sort of new crime which might arise was
in times past very dangerous to political liberty, as it greatly
enlarged the power of the crown to oppress political opponents,
but in modern days it has its convenience in facilitating the
punishment of persons committing crimes for the punishment
of which in England a new act of parliament may be necessary.
Criminal procedure in Scotland is regulated by an act of 1887
which greatly simplified indictments and proceedings. The
prosecution of crime is in the hands of public officers, procurators
fiscal, under the control of the lord advocate. Private prosecutions
are possible, but rare. Except in the case of the law
of treason, imported from England at the Union, no grand jury
is required, and the indictments are filed by the public officer.</p>

<p>The criminal law of England forms the basis of the criminal
law of all British possessions abroad, with a few exceptions, <i>e.g.</i>
the Channel Islands (still subject to the custom of
Normandy) and the anomalous case of Cyprus, where
<span class="sidenote">Other British possessions.</span>
Mahommedan law is to some extent in force. As to
India, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">infra</a></span>.</p>

<p>In many British colonies the criminal law has been codified
or at the least consolidated. Criminal codes have been passed
in Canada, New Zealand (1893), Queensland (1899) and W.
Australia (1901). Many crown colonies have codes framed on
the model prepared by the late Sir R. S. Wright for Jamaica
and revised in 1901, and in British Guiana opportunity was taken
(in 1893) to abolish the remnants of Roman-Dutch criminal
law.</p>

<p>The criminal law of South Africa, which is based on the Roman-Dutch
law, including the <i>Constitutio Criminalis Carolina</i> (1532),
is not codified. In the Transvaal and Orange River colonies
codes of criminal procedure are in force, drawn mainly from the
common and statute law of the Cape Colony with the addition
of provisions borrowed from English and colonial legislation.</p>

<p>In Mauritius the criminal law is comprised in a penal code of
1838 and a procedure code of 1853, which, with the incorporated
amendments, are to be found in the <i>Revised Laws of Mauritius</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
(1903-1904), ii. 466 et seq. The penal code is based on the Code
Napoléon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Criminal law has everywhere grown out of custom, and has
in all civilized states been largely dealt with by direct legislation.
In most civilized states (including Japan) it has been
codified by statute, to the general satisfaction of the
<span class="sidenote">Codification.</span>
people; and the conspicuous success of the Indian
penal code shows that English criminal law is susceptible of
being so treated&rdquo; (Bryce, <i>Studies</i>, ii. 34).</p>

<p>The expediency, if not the necessity, of codifying the criminal
law of England has long been apparent. The writings of Bentham
drew attention to many of its substantial defects, and the efforts
of Romilly and Mackintosh led to certain improvements embodied
in what are known as Peel&rsquo;s Acts (1826 to 1832). In 1833, at
the instance of Lord Chancellor Brougham, a royal commission
was appointed to deal with the criminal law. The nature of
the instructions indicate the crudity of the ideas then ruling as to
codification. The commissioners were directed to digest into
one statute all enactments touching crimes and the punishment
thereof, and into another statute the provisions of the common
unwritten law touching the same. The commission was renewed
in 1836 and 1837, and in 1843 a second commission was appointed.
Numerous and voluminous reports were published, including
(1848) a bill for consolidating and amending the law as to crimes
and punishments, and (1849) a like bill for criminal procedure,
indicating that the commissioners had in the meantime learned
the distinction between substantive and adjective law. Lord
Brougham in 1848 unsuccessfully introduced the first bill, and in
the end the only fruit of the reports has been certain amendments
of procedure in 1851 and the passing of the seven Criminal
Law Consolidation Acts of 1861, which deal with the statute law
as to theft, forgery, malicious injuries to property, coinage
offences and offences against the person. The reports, however,
proved of value in the revision of Macaulay&rsquo;s draft of the Indian
penal code, and led to the formation of the Statute Law Committee,
which has relieved the statute book of much dead matter.
On his return from India, impressed by the success of the Indian
penal code, Sir J. Stephen made a strong effort to obtain codification.
In 1878, at the instance of Lord Cairns, he prepared a
draft code (based on his well-known <i>Digest of the Criminal Law</i>),
which was laid before parliament and then submitted to judicial
criticism and revision. As a result of this revision a code bill
was introduced in 1880; but a dissolution intervened and no
serious effort was then made. The obstacle in the way is not
lack of reports or digests on which to frame a code, but the incapacity
of parliament to do the work itself, and its unwillingness
to trust the work to other hands.</p>

<p>The Indian penal code and criminal procedure code, by their
history, their form, and the extent and diversity of the races
and peoples to which they apply, are perhaps the
most important codes in the whole world. While the
<span class="sidenote">India.</span>
East India Company was merely a trading company holding
certain forts and trading ports in India and elsewhere, such
criminal justice as was administered under its auspices was in
the main based on the English criminal law, said to have been
introduced to some extent by the company&rsquo;s charter of 1661,
but reintroduced into the presidency laws by later charters of
1726, 1753 and 1774. (See <i>Nuncomar and Impey</i>, by Sir J.
Stephen.) From 1771 until 1860 the criminal law administered
was the Mahommedan law. When in 1771 the East Indian
Company determined to stand forth as diwan, Warren Hastings
required the courts of the mofussil (provinces), as distinct from
those of the presidency town of Fort William, to be guided in
the administration of criminal justice by Mahommedan law,
which under the Moguls had been used in criminal cases to the
exclusion of Hindu law. Difficulties arose in administration,
from the definition of crime, the nature of punishments, and in
matters of procedure, which were removed by regulations and
by enactments on English lines, especially in Bombay (1827);
and great delays and considerable injustice were caused by the
want of unity in judicial organization.</p>

<p>Between 1834 and 1837 Macaulay with three other commissioners,
Macleod, Anderson and Millet, prepared a draft
penal code for India, for which they drew not only upon English
and Indian laws and regulations but also upon Livingstone&rsquo;s
Louisiana code and the Code Napoléon. Little or nothing was
taken from the Mahommedan law. A revised draft of the penal
code by Sir B. Peacock, Sir J. W. Colville and others was completed
in 1856. In framing it the reports of the English criminal
law commissioners (published after Macaulay&rsquo;s draft code)
were considered. The draft was presented to the legislative
council in 1856, but owing to the mutiny and to objections from
missionaries, &amp;c., its passing was delayed till the 6th of October
1860. A draft scheme of criminal procedure was prepared in
India in 1847-1848, which, after submission to a commission
in England in 1853 (Government of India Act 1853), was moulded
into a draft code which passed the India legislative council
in 1861 (Act No. XXV.) and came into force in 1862. It has
been re-enacted with amendments in 1872 (Act X.), 1882
(Act X.) and 1898 (Act V.).</p>

<p>The result is that in India the criminal law is the law of the
conqueror, though for many civil purposes the law of race,
religion and caste governs. Under the codes, one set of courts
has been established throughout the country, composed of
well-paid, well-educated judges, most of the higher judicial
appointments being held by Englishmen; all those who hold
subordinate judicial posts at the same time are subjected to
a combined system of appeal and revision. The arrangement
of the Indian penal code is natural as well as logical; its basis
is the law of England stripped of technicality and local peculiarities,
whilst certain modifications are introduced to meet the
exigencies of a country such as British India. It opens with a
chapter of general explanations, and interpretations of the terms
used throughout the code. It then describes the various punishments
to which offenders are liable; follows with a list of the
exceptions regarding criminal responsibility under which a
person who otherwise would be liable to punishment is exempted
from the penal consequences of his act, such as offences committed
by children, by accident or misfortune without any
criminal intention, offences committed by lunatics, offences
committed in the exercise of the right of private defence. It
may be worth while to add, as an innovation on English law,
that an act which results in harm so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm is not
considered an offence under the code. Then follows a chapter
on abetment, in other words, the instigation of a person to
do a wrongful act. The next chapters deal with offences against
the public, including the state, the army and navy, public
tranquillity, public servants, contempts of the lawful authority
of public servants, perjury; offences relating to coin and
government stamps, to weights and measures; offences affecting
the public health, safety, convenience, decency and morals;
offences relating to religion; and offences relating to the human
body, from murder down to the infliction of any hurt. The code
then passes on to offences against property; offences relating
to forgery, including trade marks, criminal breach of contracts
for service; offences relating to marriage, defamation, criminal
intimidation, insult and annoyance. Under this last head is
included an attempt to cause a person to do anything which
that person is not legally bound to do, by inducing him to
believe that he would otherwise become subject to Divine
displeasure. The last chapter deals with attempts to commit
offences punishable by the code with transportation or imprisonment,
and the punishment is limited to one-half of the longest
term provided for the offence had it been carried out.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One peculiarity of the Penal Code which has proved eminently
successful lies in the system of illustration of the offence declared in
every section by a brief statement of some concrete case. For
instance, as illustration of the offence of an attempt to commit an
offence the following examples are given:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. &ldquo;A. makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open
a box, and finds on opening the box there is no jewel in it. He has
done an act towards the commission of theft, and therefore is guilty
under this section.</p>

<p>II. &ldquo;A. makes an attempt to pick the pocket of Z. by thrusting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
his hand into Z.&rsquo;s pocket. A. fails in the attempt in consequence
of Z. having nothing in his pocket. A. is guilty under this section.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Passing on to the system of criminal procedure which is set
forth in detail in the Code of Criminal Procedure as amended
in 1898, it is no doubt modelled on the English system,
but with considerable modifications. The principal
<span class="sidenote">Indian code of criminal procedure.</span>
steps are&mdash;(1) arrest by the police and inquiries by
the police; (2) the issue of summons or warrant by
the magistrate; (3) the mode of procedure before the magistrate,
who may either try the accused himself or commit him to the
sessions or the High Court, according to the importance of the
case; (4) procedure before the court of session; (5) appeals,
reference and revision by the High Court.</p>

<p>Elaborate provision is made for the prevention of offences,
as regards security for keeping the peace and for good behaviour,
the dispersion of unlawful assemblies, the suppression of nuisances,
disputes as to immovable property, which in all Oriental
countries constitute one of the most frequent causes of a breach
of the peace.</p>

<p>Ample provision is thus made for the prevention of offences,
and the code next deals with the mode of prosecution of offences
actually committed.</p>

<p>As a general rule, every offence is inquired into and tried by
the court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was
committed. Differing from the practice of continental countries,
all offences, even attempts, may be prosecuted after any lapse of
time. As in England, there is no statutory limitation to a
criminal offence.</p>

<p>A simple procedure is provided for what are called summons
cases, as distinguished from warrant cases&mdash;the first being
offences for which a police officer may arrest without warrant,
the second being offences where he must have a warrant, or,
in other words, minor offences and important offences. In
summons cases no formal charge need be framed. The magistrate
tells the accused the particulars of the offence charged; if he
admits his guilt, he is convicted; if he does not, evidence is
taken, and a finding is given in accordance with the facts as
proved. When the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, the
magistrate has the power to fine the complainant. The code
gives power of criminal appeal which goes much further than
the system in England.</p>

<p>In cases tried by a jury, no appeal lies as to matters of fact,
but it is allowed as to matters of law; in other cases, criminal
appeal is admitted on matters of law and fact.</p>

<p>In addition to the system of appeal, the superior courts are
entrusted with a power of revision, which is maintained automatically
by the periodical transmission to the High Courts of
calendars and statements of all cases tried by the inferior courts;
and at the same time, whenever the High Court thinks fit, it
can call for the record of any trial and pass such orders as it
deems right. All sentences of death must be confirmed by the
High Court. No appeal lies against an acquittal in any criminal
case. This system of appeal, superintendence and revision
would be totally inapplicable to England, but it has proved
eminently successful as applied to the present social condition
of the inhabitants of India. The appeals keep the judges up to
their work, revision corrects all grave mistakes, superintendence
is necessary as a kind of discipline over the conduct of judges,
who are not subjected, as in England, to the criticism of
enlightened public opinion.</p>

<p>These Indian codes form the basis of the penal, &amp;c., codes in
force in Ceylon (superseding there the Roman-Dutch law), the
Straits Settlements, the Sudan and the East Africa protectorates.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that most European states have
codified their criminal law. The earliest of continental codes
is that of Charles V., promulgated in 1532, and known
as <i>Constitutio Criminalis Carolina</i>. Austria made
<span class="sidenote">Foreign codes.</span>
further codes in 1768 (<i>Constitutio Criminalis
Theresiana</i>) and 1787 (Emperor Joseph&rsquo;s code). A new code
was framed in 1803, and amended in 1852 by reference to the Code
Napoléon; and in 1906 a completely new code existed in draft.
The Hungarian penal code dates from 1880. The Bavarian code
of 1768 of Maximilian, revised in 1861, and the Prussian code
of 1780, have been superseded by the German penal code
of 1872.</p>

<p>The most important of the continental criminal codes are those
of France, the <i>Code Pénal</i> (1810) and the <i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction
Criminelle</i> (1808)&mdash;the work of Napoleon the Great and his
advisers, which professedly incorporate much of the Roman law.</p>

<p>The Belgian codes (1867), and the Dutch penal code (1880),
closely follow the French model. In Spain the penal code dates
from 1870, the procedure code from 1886. The Spanish American
republics for the most part also have codes. Portugal has a
penal code (1852). In Italy the procedure code and the penal
code, perhaps the completest yet framed, are of 1890. The
Swedish code dates from 1864. The Norwegian code was passed
in May 1902, and came into force in 1905. Japan has a code
based on a study of European and American models; and
Switzerland is framing a federal criminal code.</p>

<p>In the United States no federal criminal code is possible; but
most states, following the lead of Louisiana, have digested their
criminal law and procedure more or less effectually into penal
codes.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIMINOLOGY,<a name="ar270" id="ar270"></a></span> the name given to a new branch of social
science, devoted to the discussion of the genesis of crime (<i>q.v.</i>),
which has received much attention in recent years. The expression
is one of modern coinage, and originated with the speculative
theories first advanced by the school of sociologists which had
the Italian savant, Professor Lombroso, at its head. He discovered
or was supposed to have discovered a criminal type,
the &ldquo;instinctive&rdquo; or &ldquo;born&rdquo; criminal, a creature who had
come into the world predestined to evil deeds, and who could
be surely recognized by certain stigmata, certain facial, physical,
even moral birthmarks, the possession of which, presumably
ineradicable, foredoomed him to the commission of crime. Dr
Lombroso, in his ingenious work <i>L&rsquo;Uomo delinquente</i>, found many
attentive and appreciative, not to say bigoted followers. Large
numbers of dissentients exist, however, and the conclusions of the
Italian school have been warmly contested and on very plausible
grounds. If the doctrines be fully accepted the whole theory of
free-will breaks down, and we are faced with the paradox that
we have no right to punish an irresponsible being who is impelled
to crime by congenital causes, entirely beyond his control.
The &ldquo;instinctive&rdquo; criminal, under this reasoning, must be
classed with the lunatic whom we cannot justly, and practically
never do, punish. There are other points on which proof of the
existence of the criminal type fails absolutely. The whole
theory illustrates a modern phase of psychological doctrine,
and the subject has exercised such a potent effect on modern
thought that the claims and pretensions of the Lombroso school
must be examined and disposed of.</p>

<p>The alleged discovery of the &ldquo;born-criminal&rdquo; as a separate
and distinct genus of the human species was first published by
Dr Lombroso in 1876 as the result of long continued investigation
and examination of a number of imprisoned criminals. The
personality of this human monster was to be recognized by
certain inherent moral and physical traits, not all displayed
by the same individual but generally appearing in conjunction
and then constituting the type. These traits have been defined
as follows:&mdash;various brain and cerebral anomalies; receding
foreheads; massive jaws, prognathous chins; skulls without
symmetry; ears long, large and projecting (the ear <i>ad ansa</i>);
noses rectilinear, wrinkles strongly marked, even in the young
and in both sexes, hair abundant on the head, scanty on the cheeks
and chin; eyes feline, fixed, cold, glassy, ferocious; bad repellent
faces. Much stress is laid upon the physiognomy, and it is said
that it is independent of nationality; two natives of the same
country do not so nearly resemble each other as two criminals of
different countries. Other peculiarities are:&mdash;great width of
the extended arms (<i>l&rsquo;envergure</i> of the French), extraordinary
ape-like agility; left-handedness as well as ambi-dexterism;
obtuse sense of smell, taste and sometimes of hearing, although
the eyesight is superior to that of normal people. &ldquo;In general,&rdquo;
to quote Lombroso, &ldquo;the born criminal has projecting ears, thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
hair and thin beard, projecting frontal eminences, enormous jaws,
a square and protruding chin, large cheek bones and frequent
gesticulation.&rdquo; So much for the anatomical and physiological
peculiarities of the criminal. There remain the psychological
or mental characteristics, so far as they have been observed.
Moral insensibility is attributed to him, a dull conscience that
never pricks and a general freedom from remorse. He is said to
be generally lacking in intelligence, hence his stupidity, the want
of proper precautions, both before and after an offence, which leads
so often to his detection and capture. His vanity is strongly
marked and shown in the pride taken in infamous achievements
rather than personal appearance.</p>

<p>No sooner was this new theory made public than the very
existence of the supposed type was questioned and more evidence
demanded. A French savant declared that Lombroso&rsquo;s portraits
were very similar to the photographs of his friends. Save for the
dirt, the recklessness, the weariness and the misery so often seen
on it, the face of the criminal does not differ from that of an honest
man&rsquo;s. It was pointed out that if certain traits denoted the
criminal, the converse should be seen in the honest man. A
pertinent objection was that the deductions had been made
from insufficient premises. The criminologists had worked upon
a comparatively small number of criminals, and yet made their
discoveries applicable to the whole class. The facts were collected
from too small an area and no definite conclusions could be based
upon them. Moreover, the criminologists were by no means
unanimous. They differed amongst themselves and often contradicted
one another as to the characteristics exhibited.</p>

<p>The controversy was long maintained. Many eminent
persons have been arrayed on either side. In Italy Lombroso
was supported by Colajanni, Ferri, Garofalo; in France by
J. A. Lacassagne. In Germany Lombroso has found few
followers; Dr Naëcke of Hubertusburg near Leipzig, one of the
most eminent of German alienists, declined to admit there was
any special animal type. Van Hamel of Amsterdam gives only
a qualified approval. In England it stands generally condemned,
because it gives no importance to circumstance and passing
temptation, or to domestic or social environment, as affecting
the causation of crime. Dr Nicholson of Broadmoor has said that
&ldquo;if the criminal is such by predestination, heredity or accidental
flaws or anomalies in brain or physical structure, he is such for
good and all; no cure is possible, all the plans and processes
for his betterment, education, moral training and disciplinary
treatment are nugatory and vain.&rdquo; No weight can then be
attached to evil example, or unfavourable social surroundings,
in moulding and forming character, particularly during the more
plastic periods of childhood and youth.</p>

<p>The pertinent question remains, has the study and development
of criminology served any useful purpose? Little perhaps can
come of it in its restricted sense, but it has taken a wider meaning
and embraces larger researches. It has inquired into the sources
and causes of crime, it has collected criminal statistics and
deduced valuable lessons from them, it has sought and obtained
guidance in the best methods of prevention, repression, and
forms of procedure. The champions of law and order have been
greatly aided by the criminologist in carrying on the continual
combat with crime, and in dealing with the most complicated
of social phenomena. The new science has, in fact, by accumulating
a number of curious details, in recording the psychology,
the secret desires, the springs of the criminal&rsquo;s nefarious actions,
his corrigibility or the reverse, &ldquo;prepared the way to his sociological
explanation&rdquo; (Tarde). Thanks to the labours of the
criminologist we are moving steadily forward to a future improved
treatment of the criminal, and may thus arrive at the
increased morality and greater safety of society. Very appreciable
advance has been made in the increased attention paid to
juvenile and adult crime, the acceptance of the theory, now
well established, that there is an especially criminal age, a period
when the moral fibre is weaker and more yielding to temptation
to crime, when happily human nature is more malleable and
susceptible to improvement and reform.</p>

<p>The study of criminology has, however, gone far to satisfy
us that the true genesis of crime is not to be sought in the anatomical
anomalies of individuals, or in the fact that there are people
who under &ldquo;any social conditions whatever and of any nationality
at no matter what epoch, would have undoubtedly become
murderers and thieves.&rdquo; On the contrary it may be safely
assumed that many such would have done no wrong if they had,
<i>e.g.</i>, been born rich, had been free from the pressing needs that
drove them into crime, and had escaped the evil influences of
their surroundings. The criminologists have strengthened the
hands of administrators, have emphasized the paramount importance
of child-rescue and judicious direction of adults, have
held the balance between penal methods, advocating the moralizing
effect of open-air labour as opposed to prolonged isolation,
and have insisted upon the desirability of indefinite detention
for all who have obstinately determined to wage perpetual war

<p><span class="bold">CRIMMITZSCHAU,<a name="ar271" id="ar271"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Krimmitschau</span>, a town of Germany,
in the kingdom of Saxony, on the Pleisse and the main Leipzig-Hof
railway, 7 m. N.W. from Zwickau. Pop. (1900) 22,845.
The most important industries of the town are the manufacture
of buckskin, the spinning of carded yarn and vicuna-wool,
and the processes of dyeing, finishing and wool-spinning connected
with these. Among other manufactures are brushes,
boilers and the like, machinery, metal ware generally, the
cases and other parts of watches. The town has a modern
school (Realschule), a commercial school, and technical schools
for weaving and finishing.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIMP<a name="ar272" id="ar272"></a></span> (possibly connected with &ldquo;crimp,&rdquo; to draw together,
or fold in parallel lines, in the sense of &ldquo;confine&rdquo;; the primary
meaning, however, seems to be that of &ldquo;agent,&rdquo; and the word
may be a distinct one, of which the origin is lost), an agent for
the supplying of soldiers and sailors, by kidnapping, drugging,
decoying or other illegal means. Crimps were formerly regularly
employed in the days of impressment (<i>q.v.</i>). Now the term is
used, first of any one who engages to supply merchant seamen
without a licence from the Board of Trade, and is not either the
owner, master or mate of the ship, or is not bona fide the servant,
and in the constant employment of the owner, or is not a superintendent
(Merchant Shipping Act 1894, § 111); and, with a
wide application, of the extortionate lodging or boarding-house
keepers, who are generally in league with the &ldquo;crimp&rdquo; proper.</p>

<p>Sections 212 to 219 inclusive of the above act provide for the
protection of merchant seamen in the United Kingdom from
imposition. Local authorities at seaports have power to make
by-laws for the licensing and regulating of lodging-houses for
sailors, and to inflict penalties for the infringement thereof.
If this power be not exercised, the Board of Trade may do so.
Penalties are also imposed by the act for overcharging by
lodging-house keepers, for detaining of seamen&rsquo;s effects, and for
soliciting. Unauthorized persons are prohibited from boarding
a ship in port without leave. The Board of Trade officer at a port
may provide money for sending a seaman to his home on discharge,
and may forward his wages after deducting the expenses.
Facilities are also given for having wages sent home from foreign
ports at a small charge. These provisions have practically
killed &ldquo;crimping&rdquo; in the United Kingdom. In the ports of the
United States of America crimping was long prevalent, especially
on the Pacific coast, and its prevention was very difficult, but
state regulations as to the licensing of boarding-houses, and
the limitation of the amount of so-called &ldquo;blood-money&rdquo; paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
by masters of vessels to the suppliers of crews to ships denuded
by desertions, have reduced the abuse materially.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;to shanghai&rdquo; is used of a more serious offence.
Literally meaning &ldquo;to ship to Shanghai,&rdquo; in China, it is applied
to the drugging or rendering unconscious by violence or other
means of persons, whether sailors or not, and shipping them
to distant ports, in order fraudulently to obtain money in advance
of wages, or for the sake of the premium paid for supplying crews.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRIMSON<a name="ar273" id="ar273"></a></span>, the name of a strong, bright red colour tinged to
a greater or less degree with purple. It is the colour of the dye
produced from the dried bodies of the cochineal insect (<i>Coccus
cacti</i>). The word, in its earlier forms <i>cremesin, crymysyn</i>, also
<i>cramoysin</i>, cf. &ldquo;cramoisy,&rdquo; the name of a red cloth, is adapted
from the Med. Lat. <i>cremesinus</i> for <i>kermesinus</i> or <i>carmesinus</i>,
the dye produced from the insect <i>Kermes</i> (<i>Coccus ilicis</i>), Arab.
<i>quirmiz</i>, which Skeat (<i>Etym. Dict.</i>, 1898) connects with the
Sanskrit <i>krimi</i>, cognate with Lat. <i>vermis</i> and Eng. &ldquo;worm.&rdquo;
From the Lat. <i>carminus</i>, a shortened form of carmesinus,
comes &ldquo;carmine&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRINOLINE<a name="ar275" id="ar275"></a></span> (a Fr. word formed of the Lat. <i>crinis</i>, hair, and
<i>linum</i>, thread), a stiffening material made of horse-hair and
cotton or linen thread. Substitutes for this, such as the straw-like
material used in making hat shapes, are also known by the
same name. From the use of the material to expand ladies&rsquo; skirts
the term was applied, during the third quarter of the 19th
century, when the fashion of wearing greatly expanded skirts
was at its height, to the whalebone and steel hoops employed
to support the skirts thus worn (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Costume</a></span>). The term is also
used of structures resembling these articles, especially of the
framework of booms, spars and netting forming a protection
for a warship against torpedo attack.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRINUM<a name="ar276" id="ar276"></a></span>, a genus (nat. ord. Amaryllidaceae) of bulbous
plants with rather broad leaves and a solid leafless stem, bearing
a cluster of handsome white or red funnel-shaped regular flowers.
They are well known in cultivation, and owing to the wide
distribution of the genus different methods are adopted with
different species. Some require the hot, moist temperature of
a stove; such are <i>C. amabile</i>, a native of Sumatra, <i>C. amoenum</i>
(India), <i>C. Balfourii</i> (Socotra), <i>C. giganteum</i> (West tropical
Africa), <i>C. Kirkii</i> (Zanzibar), <i>C. latifolium</i> (India), <i>C. zeylanicum</i>
(tropical Asia and Africa), and others. Others thrive in a greenhouse;
such are <i>C. asiaticum</i>, a widely distributed plant on the
sea-coast of tropical Asia, <i>C. capense</i> and <i>C. longiflorum</i>, from
the Cape, and <i>C. Macowani</i> and <i>C. Moorei</i> from Natal. <i>C.
asiaticum</i>, <i>C. capense</i> and <i>C. Macowani</i> will also thrive in sheltered
positions in the garden.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIOBOLIUM<a name="ar277" id="ar277"></a></span>, the sacrifice of a ram in the cult of Attis and
the Great Mother. It seems to have been a special ceremony
instituted after the rise, and on the analogy of the taurobolium
(<i>q.v.</i>), which was performed in honour of the Great Mother, for
the purpose of giving fuller recognition to Attis in the duality
which he formed with the Mother. There is no evidence of its
existence either in Asia or in Italy before the taurobolium came
into prominence (after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 134). When the criobolium was
performed in conjunction with the taurobolium, the altar was
almost invariably inscribed to both the Mother and Attis, while
the inscription was to the Mother alone when the taurobolium
only was performed. The celebration of the criobolium was
widespread, and its importance such that it was sometimes
performed in place of the taurobolium (<i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i> vi.
505, 506). The details and effect of the ceremony were no doubt
similar to those of the taurobolium.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRIPPLE CREEK<a name="ar278" id="ar278"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Teller county,
almost at the geographical centre of Colorado, U.S.A., one of
the phenomenal mining camps of the West. Pop. (1900)
10,147 (1408 foreign-born); (1910) 6206. The city is served
by three railways&mdash;the Colorado Springs &amp; Cripple Creek
District (a branch of the Colorado &amp; Southern), the Midland
Terminal (which connects at Divide, 30 m. distant by rail, with
the Colorado Midland), and the Florence &amp; Cripple Creek.
Cripple Creek is situated on a mountain slope in a pocket amid
the ranges, about 9600 ft. above the sea at the head of the stream
after which it is named. The municipal water-supply is drawn
from Pike&rsquo;s Peak, 10 m. distant. The interest of the city is in
its extraordinary mines and their history. Cripple Creek&rsquo;s site
was frequently prospected after 1860, and &ldquo;colours&rdquo; and gold
&ldquo;float&rdquo; were always found, but not until February 1891 was
the source discovered. Cripple Creek was at that time a cattle
range. In 1891 the output of gold in the district was valued
at $449, in 1892 at $583,010, and in the next three years at
$2,010,367, $2,908,702 and $6,879,137 respectively. From
1891 to 1906 the total production of gold was valued at
$168,584,331; in 1905<a name="FnAnchor_1o" id="FnAnchor_1o" href="#Footnote_1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the product of gold was valued at
$15,411,724, the total for the whole state being valued at
$25,023,973; in 1906 the output for the district was valued
at $14,253,245, out of $23,210,629 for the entire state. The
development of the camp into a yellow-pine town and then into
something more like a substantial city was marvellously rapid.
The first railway was completed in 1894. In the same year a
great strike&mdash;one of the most famous in American industrial
history&mdash;threatening civil war, temporarily closed the mines;
in 1896 fire almost destroyed the city; in 1903-1904 a second
strike, lasting more than a year and greater than the first,
occurred. The first strike, which was for an eight-hour day
and $3.00 wage, was won by the miners. The second, for the
recognition outright of the union organization of the miners,
secured only a reaffirmation of the former conditions. The ores
are almost exclusively gold, tellurides being the most characteristic
form, and occur in fissure veins. Outcroppings were very
rare, as the veins were covered with loose wash, and this
accounted for the late opening of the field. The field covers a
district about 8 × 10 m. Some peculiarities of the ores have
required the use of new methods in their treatment, and in
general the development of mining methods and machinery is
of a wonderful character. The whole surrounding country is
seamed with miles of tunnels in granite, and the hillsides are
dotted everywhere with enormous dumps. The most famous
mines have been the &ldquo;Independence&rdquo; (1891) and the &ldquo;Portland&rdquo;
(1892). The latter had in 1904 more than 25 m. of
workings above the 1100-ft. level. In 1903 the El Paso drain
was completed, to unwater the western half of the field to the
880-ft. level, greatly increasing many mine values and outputs;
in 1906 the work of drainage was again taken up, and work on
a long bore was begun in May 1907. There are smelters and
cyanide extracters in the district, but the bulk of the ore product
is shipped to other places for treatment. Among the towns
around Cripple Creek in the same mining district is Victor,
pop. (1910) 3162, incorporated in 1894, chartered as a city in
1898.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRISA<a name="ar279" id="ar279"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Crissa</span>, in ancient geography, one of the oldest
cities of Greece, situated in Phocis, on one of the spurs of
Parnassus. Its name occurs both in the <i>Iliad</i> and in the Homeric
<i>Hymns</i>, where it is described as a powerful place, with a rich
and fertile territory, reaching to the sea, and including within
its limits the sanctuary of Pytho. As the town of Delphi grew
up around the shrine, and the seaport of Cirrha arose on the
Crisean Gulf, Crisa gradually lost much of its importance. By
the ancients themselves the name of Cirrha was so often substituted
for that of Crisa, that it soon became doubtful whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
these names indicated the same city or not. The question was
practically settled by the investigations of H. N. Ulrichs. From
its position Cirrha commanded the approach to Delphi, and its
inhabitants became obnoxious to the Greeks from the heavy
tolls which they exacted from the devotees who thronged to
the shrine. The Amphictyonic Council declared war (the first
Sacred War) against the Criseans in 595 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and having taken
the town, razed it to the ground, and consecrated its territory
to the temple at Delphi. The plunder of the town was sold to
defray the expenses of the Pythian games. In 339 the people
of Amphissa began to rebuild the town of Cirrha and to cultivate
the plain. This act brought on the second Sacred War, the
conduct of which was entrusted by the Amphictyons to Philip
of Macedon, who took Amphissa (mod. Salona) in the following
year. The ruins of Crisa may be still seen where the ravine of
the Pleistus joins the plain; its name is probably preserved by
the modern Chryso.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRISPI, FRANCESCO<a name="ar280" id="ar280"></a></span> (1819-1901), Italian statesman, was
born at Ribéra in Sicily on the 4th of October 1819. In 1846
he established himself as advocate at Naples. On the outbreak
of the Sicilian revolution at Palermo (January 12, 1848) he
hastened to the island and took an active part in guiding the
insurrection. Upon the restoration of the Bourbon government
(May 15, 1849) he was excluded from the amnesty and compelled
to flee to Piedmont. Here he unsuccessfully applied for a
situation as communal secretary of Verolengo, and eked out a
penurious existence by journalism. Implicated in the Mazzinian
conspiracy at Milan (February 6, 1853), he was expelled from
Piedmont, and obliged to take refuge at Malta, whence he fled
to Paris. Expelled from France, he joined Mazzini in London,
and continued to conspire for the redemption of Italy. On the
15th of June 1859 he returned to Italy after publishing a letter
repudiating the aggrandizement of Piedmont, and proclaiming
himself a republican and a partisan of national unity.
Twice in that year he went the round of the Sicilian cities
in disguise, and prepared the insurrectionary movement of
1860.</p>

<p>Upon his return to Genoa he organized, with Bertani, Bixio,
Medici and Garibaldi, the expedition of the Thousand, and
overcoming by a stratagem the hesitation of Garibaldi, secured
the departure of the expedition on the 5th of May 1860. Disembarking
at Marsala on the 11th, Crispi on the 13th, at Salemi,
drew up the proclamation whereby Garibaldi assumed the
dictatorship of Sicily, with the programme: &ldquo;Italy and Victor
Emmanuel.&rdquo; After the fall of Palermo, Crispi was appointed
minister of the interior and of finance in the Sicilian provisional
government, but was shortly afterwards obliged to resign on
account of the struggle between Garibaldi and the emissaries of
Cavour with regard to the question of immediate annexation.
Appointed secretary to Garibaldi, Crispi secured the resignation
of Depretis, whom Garibaldi had appointed pro-dictator, and
would have continued his fierce opposition to Cavour at Naples,
where he had been placed by Garibaldi in the foreign office, had
not the advent of the Italian regular troops and the annexation
of the Two Sicilies to Italy brought about Garibaldi&rsquo;s withdrawal
to Caprera and Crispi&rsquo;s own resignation. Entering parliament
in 1861 as deputy of the extreme Left for Castelvetrano, Crispi
acquired the reputation of being the most aggressive and most
impetuous member of the republican party. In 1864, however,
he made at the chamber a monarchical profession of faith, in
the famous phrase afterwards repeated in his letter to Mazzini:
&ldquo;The monarchy unites us; the republic would divide us.&rdquo;
In 1860 he refused to enter the Ricasoli cabinet; in 1867 he
worked to impede the Garibaldian invasion of the papal states,
foreseeing the French occupation of Rome and the disaster of
Mentana. By methods of the same character as those subsequently
employed against himself by Cavallotti, he carried on
the violent agitation known as the Lobbia affair, in which sundry
conservative deputies were, on insufficient grounds, accused
of corruption. On the outbreak of the Franco-German War he
worked energetically to impede the projected alliance with
France, and to drive the Lanza cabinet to Rome. The death of
Ratazzi in 1873 induced Crispi&rsquo;s friends to put forward his
candidature to the leadership of the Left; but Crispi, anxious
to reassure the crown, secured the election of Depretis. After
the advent of the Left he was elected (November 1876) president
of the chamber. During the autumn of 1877 he went to London,
Paris and Berlin on a confidential mission, establishing cordial
personal relationships with Gladstone, Granville and other
English statesmen, and with Bismarck.</p>

<p>In December 1877 he replaced Nicotera as minister of the
interior in the Depretis cabinet, his short term of office (70 days)
being signalized by a series of important events. On January 9,
1878, the death of Victor Emmanuel and the accession of King
Humbert enabled Crispi to secure the formal establishment of a
unitary monarchy, the new monarch taking the title of Humbert
I. of Italy instead of Humbert IV. of Savoy. The remains of
Victor Emmanuel were interred in the Pantheon instead of being
transported to the Savoy Mausoleum at Superga. On the 9th
of February, 1879, the death of Pius IX. necessitated a conclave,
the first to be held after the unification of Italy. Crispi, helped
by Mancini and Cardinal Pecci (afterwards Leo XIII.), persuaded
the Sacred College to hold the conclave in Rome, and prorogued
the chamber lest any untoward manifestation should mar the
solemnity of the event. The statesmanlike qualities displayed
on this occasion were unavailing to avert the storm of indignation
conjured up by Crispi&rsquo;s opponents in connexion with a charge
of bigamy not susceptible of legal proof. Crispi was compelled
to resign office, although the judicial authorities upheld the
invalidity of his early marriage, contracted at Malta in 1853,
and ratified his subsequent union with Signora Barbagallo.
For nine years Crispi remained politically under a cloud, but in
1887 returned to office as minister of the interior in the Depretis
cabinet, succeeding to the premiership upon the death of Depretis
(July 29, 1887).</p>

<p>One of his first acts as premier was a visit to Bismarck, whom
he desired to consult upon the working of the Triple Alliance.
Basing his foreign policy upon the alliance, as supplemented by
the naval <i>entente</i> with Great Britain negotiated by his predecessor,
Count Robilant, Crispi assumed a resolute attitude towards
France, breaking off the prolonged and unfruitful negotiations
for a new Franco-Italian commercial treaty, and refusing the
French invitation to organize an Italian section at the Paris
Exhibition of 1889. At home Crispi secured the adoption of the
Sanitary and Commercial Codes, and reformed the administration
of justice. Forsaken by his Radical friends, Crispi governed with
the help of the Right until, on the 31st of January 1891, an
intemperate allusion to the <i>sante memorie</i> of the conservative
party led to his overthrow. In December 1893 the impotence
of the Giolitti cabinet to restore public order, then menaced by
disturbances in Sicily and in Lunigiana, gave rise to a general
demand that Crispi should return to power. Upon resuming
office he vigorously suppressed the disorders, and steadily
supported the energetic remedies adopted by Sonnino, minister
of finance, to save Italian credit, which had been severely shaken
by the bank and financial crises of 1892-1893. Crispi&rsquo;s uncompromising
suppression of disorder, and his refusal to abandon
either the Triple Alliance or the Eritrean colony, or to forsake
his colleague Sonnino, caused a breach between him and the
radical leader Cavallotti. Cavallotti then began against him a
pitiless campaign of defamation. An unsuccessful attempt upon
Crispi&rsquo;s life by the anarchist Lega brought a momentary truce,
but Cavallotti&rsquo;s attacks were soon renewed more fiercely than
ever. They produced so little effect that the general election of
1895 gave Crispi a huge majority, but, a year later, the defeat
of the Italian army at Adowa in Abyssinia brought about his
resignation. The ensuing Rudini cabinet lent itself to Cavallotti&rsquo;s
campaign, and at the end of 1897 the judicial authorities applied
to the chamber for permission to prosecute Crispi for embezzlement.
A parliamentary commission, appointed to inquire into
the charges against him, discovered only that Crispi, on assuming
office in 1893, had found the secret service coffers empty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
had borrowed from a state bank the sum of £12,000 for secret
service, repaying it with the monthly instalments granted in
regular course by the treasury. The commission, considering
this proceeding irregular, proposed, and the chamber adopted,
a vote of censure, but refused to authorize a prosecution. Crispi
resigned his seat in parliament, but was re-elected by an overwhelming
majority in April 1898 by his Palermo constituents.
For some time he took little part in active politics, chiefly on
account of his growing blindness. A successful operation for
cataract restored his eyesight in June 1900, and notwithstanding
his 81 years he resumed to some extent his former political
activity. Soon afterwards, however, his health began to give
way permanently, and he died at Naples on the 12th of August
1901.</p>

<p>The importance of Crispi in Italian public life depended less
upon the many reforms accomplished under his administrations
than upon his intense patriotism, remarkable fibre, and capacity
for administering to his fellow-countrymen the political tonic of
which they stood in constant need. In regard to foreign politics
he greatly contributed to raise Italian prestige and to dispel
the reputation for untrustworthiness and vacillation acquired
by many of his predecessors. If in regard to France his policy
appeared to lack suavity and circumspection, it must be remembered
that the French republic was then engaged in active
anti-Italian schemes and was working, both at the Vatican and
in the sphere of colonial politics, to create a situation that should
compel Italy to bow to French exigencies and to abandon the
Triple Alliance. Crispi was prepared to cultivate good relations
with France, but refused to yield to pressure or to submit to dictation;
and in this attitude he was firmly supported by the bulk
of his fellow-countrymen. The criticism freely directed against
him was based rather upon the circumstances of his unfortunate
private life and the misdeeds of an unscrupulous <i>entourage</i> which
traded upon his name than upon his personal or political shortcomings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRISPIN<a name="ar281" id="ar281"></a></span> and <span class="bold">CRISPINIAN</span>, the patron saints of shoemakers,
whose festival is celebrated on the 25th of October. Their
history is largely legendary, and there exists no trace of it earlier
than the 8th century. It is said that they were brothers and
members of a noble family in Rome. They gave up their property
and travelled to Soissons (Noviodunum, Augusta Sucessionum),
where they supported themselves by shoemaking and made many
converts to Christianity. The emperor Maximianus (Herculius)
condemned them to death. His prefect Rictiovarus endeavoured
to carry out the sentence, but they emerged unharmed from all
the ordeals to which he subjected them, and the weapons he used
recoiled against the executioners. Rictiovarus in disgust cast
himself into the fire, or the caldron of boiling tar, from which
they had emerged refreshed. At last Maximian had their heads
cut off (c. 287-300). Their remains were buried at Soissons,
but were afterwards removed, partly by Charlemagne to Osnabrück
(where a festival is observed annually on the 20th of June)
and partly to the chapel of St Lawrence in Rome. The abbeys
of St Crépin-en-Chaye (the remains of which still form part of a
farmhouse on the river Aisne, N.N.W. of Soissons), of St Crépin-le-Petit,
and St Crépin-le-Grand (the site of which is occupied
by a house belonging to the Sisters of Mercy), in or near Soissons,
commemorated the places sanctified by their imprisonment and
burial. There are also relics at Fulda, and a Kentish tradition
claims that the bodies of the martyrs were cast into the sea and
cast on shore on Romney Marsh (see <i>Acta SS. Bolland</i>, xi. 495;
A. Butler, <i>Lives of the Saints</i>. October 25th).</p>

<p>Especially in France, but also in England and in other parts of
Europe, the festival of St Crispin was for centuries the occasion
of solemn processions and merry-making, in which gilds of shoemakers
took the chief part. At Troyes, where the gild of St
Crispin was reconstituted as late as 1820, an annual festival is
celebrated in the church of St Urban. In England and Scotland
the day acquired additional importance as the anniversary of
the battle of Agincourt (cf. Shakespeare, <i>Henry V.</i> iv. 3); the
symbolical processions in honour of &ldquo;King Crispin&rdquo; at Stirling
and Edinburgh were particularly famous.</p>

imprisoned. In 411 he helped to put down the Four Hundred,
and was instrumental in procuring the recall of Alcibiades.
He was banished (probably in the democratic reaction of 407)
and fled to Thessaly, where he stirred up the Penestae (the helots
of Thessaly) against their masters, and endeavoured to establish
a democracy. Returning to Athens he was made ephor by the
oligarchical party; and he was the most cruel and unscrupulous
of the Thirty Tyrants who in 404 were appointed by the Lacedaemonians.
He was slain in battle against Thrasybulus and the
returning democrats. Critias was a man of varied talents&mdash;poet,
orator, historian and philosopher. Some fragments of his
elegies will be found in Bergk, <i>Poetae Lyrici Graeci</i>. He was
also the author of several tragedies and of biographies of distinguished
poets (possibly in verse).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRITICISM<a name="ar283" id="ar283"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="kritês">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, a judge, <span class="grk" title="krinein">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to decide,
to give an authoritative opinion), the art of judging the qualities
and values of an aesthetic object, whether in literature or the
fine arts.<a name="FnAnchor_1p" id="FnAnchor_1p" href="#Footnote_1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It involves, in the first instance, the formation
and expression of a judgment on the qualities of anything, and
Matthew Arnold defined it in this general sense as &ldquo;a disinterested
endeavour to learn and propagate the best that is known and
thought in the world.&rdquo; It has come, however, to possess a
secondary and specialized meaning as a published analysis
of the qualities and characteristics of a work in literature or fine
art, itself taking the form of independent literature. The sense
in which criticism is taken as implying censure, the &ldquo;picking
holes&rdquo; in any statement or production, is frequent, but it is
entirely unjustifiable. There is nothing in the proper scope of
criticism which presupposes blame. On the contrary, a work
of perfect beauty and fitness, in which no fault could possibly
be found with justice, is as proper a subject for criticism to deal
with as a work of the greatest imperfection. It may be perfectly
just to state that a book or a picture is &ldquo;beneath criticism,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> is so wanting in all qualities of originality and technical
excellence that time would merely be wasted in analysing it.
But it can never be properly said that a work is &ldquo;above criticism,&rdquo;
although it may be &ldquo;above censure,&rdquo; for the very complexity
of its merits and the fulness of its beauties tempt the
skill of the analyser and reward it.</p>

<p>It is necessary at the threshold of an examination of the
history of criticism to expose this laxity of speech, since nothing
is more confusing to a clear conception of this art than to suppose
that it consists in an effort to detect what is blameworthy.
Candid criticism should be neither benevolent nor adverse;
its function is to give a just judgment, without partiality or bias.
A critic (<span class="grk" title="kritikos">&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>) is one who exercises the art of criticism,
who sets himself up, or is set up, as a judge of literary and
artistic merit. The irritability of mankind, which easily forgets
and neglects praise, but cannot forgive the rankling poison of
blame, has set upon the word <i>critic</i> a seal which is even more
unamiable than that of <i>criticism</i>. It takes its most savage form
in Benjamin Disraeli&rsquo;s celebrated and deplorable <i>dictum</i>, &ldquo;the
critics are the men who have failed in literature and art.&rdquo; It
is plain that such names as those of Aristotle, Dante, Dryden,
Joshua Reynolds, Sainte-Beuve and Matthew Arnold are not
to be thus swept by a reckless fulmination. There have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
many critics who brought from failure in imaginative composition
a cavilling, jealous and ignoble temper, who have mainly
exercised their function in indulging the evil passion of envy.
But, so far as they have done this, they have proved themselves
bad critics, and neither minute care, nor a basis of learning, nor
wide experience of literature, salutary as all these must be,
can avail to make that criticism valuable which is founded on
the desire to exaggerate fault-finding and to emphasize censure
unfairly. The examination of what has been produced by other
ages of human thought is much less liable to this dangerous error
than the attempt to estimate contemporary works of art and
literature. There are few indeed whom personal passion can
blind to the merits of a picture of the 15th or a poem of the
17th century. In the higher branches of historical criticism,
prejudice of this ignoble sort is hardly possible, and therefore,
in considering criticism in its ideal forms, it is best to leave out
of consideration that invidious and fugitive species which bears
the general name of &ldquo;reviewing.&rdquo; This pedestrian criticism,
indeed, is useful and even indispensable, but it is, by its very
nature, ephemeral, and it is liable to a multitude of drawbacks.
Even when the reviewer is, or desires to be, strictly just, it is
almost impossible for him to stand far enough back from the
object under review to see it in its proper perspective. He is
dazzled, or scandalized, by its novelty; he has formed a preconceived
notion of the degree to which its author should be
encouraged or depressed; he is himself, in all cases, an element
in the mental condition which he attempts to judge, and if
not positively a defendant is at least a juryman in the court over
which he ought to preside with remote impartiality.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as the definition of criticism in its pure
sense, that it should consist in the application, in the most competent
form, of the principles of literary composition. Those
principles are the general aesthetics upon which taste is founded;
they take the character of rules of writing. From the days of
Aristotle the existence of such rules has not been doubted, but
different orders of mind in various ages have given them diverse
application, and upon this diversity the fluctuations of taste
are founded. It is now generally admitted that in past ages
critics have too often succumbed to the temptation to regulate
taste rigidly, and to lay down rules that shall match every case
with a formula. Over-legislation has been the bane of official
criticism, and originality, especially in works of creative imagination,
has been condemned because it did not conform to existing
rules. Such instances of want of contemporary appreciation
as the reception given to William Blake or Keats, or even Milton,
are quoted to prove the futility of criticism. As a matter of
fact they do nothing of the kind. They merely prove the
immutable principles which underlie all judgment of artistic
products to have been misunderstood or imperfectly obeyed
during the life-times of those illustrious men. False critics have
built domes of glass, as Voltaire put it, between the heavens and
themselves, domes which genius has to shatter in pieces before
it can make itself comprehended. In critical application formulas
are often useful, but they should be held lightly; when the
formula becomes the tyrant where it should be the servant of
thought, fatal error is imminent. What is required above all
else by a critic is knowledge, tempered with good sense, and
combined with an exquisite delicacy of taste. He who possesses
these qualities may go wrong in certain instances, but his error
cannot become radical, and he is always open to correction. It
is not his business crudely to pronounce a composition &ldquo;good&rdquo;
or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;; he must be able to show why it is &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
wherein it is &ldquo;bad&rdquo;; he must admire with independence and
blame with careful candour. He must above all be assiduous
to escape from pompous generalizations, which conceal lack of
thought under a flow of words. The finest criticism should take
every circumstance of the case into consideration, and hold it
necessary, if possible, to know the author as well as the book.
A large part of the reason why the criticism of productions of
the past is so much more fruitful than mere contemporary
reviewing, is that by remoteness from the scene of action the
critic is able to make himself familiar with all the elements of
age, place and medium which affected the writer at the moment
of his composition. In short, knowledge and even taste are not
sufficient for perfect criticism without the infusion of a still
rarer quality, breadth of sympathy.</p>

<p>Criticism has been one of the latest branches of literature to
reach maturity, but from very early times the instinct which
induces mankind to review what it has produced led to the
composition of imperfect but often extremely valuable bodies
of opinion. What makes these early criticisms tantalizing is
that the moral or political aspects of literature had not disengaged
themselves from the purely intellectual or aesthetic.</p>

<p>To pass to an historical examination of the subject, we find
that in antiquity Aristotle was regarded as the father and almost
as the founder of literary criticism. Yet before his day, three
Greek writers of eminence had examined, in more or less fulness,
the principles of composition; these were Plato, Isocrates and
Aristophanes. The comedy of <i>The Frogs</i>, by the latter, is the
earliest specimen we possess of hostile literary criticism, being
devoted to ridicule of the plays of Euripides. In the cases of
Plato and Isocrates, criticism takes the form mainly of an
examination of the rules of rhetoric. We reach, however, much
firmer ground when we arrive at Aristotle, whose <i>Poetics</i> and
<i>Rhetoric</i> are among the most valuable treatises which antiquity
has handed down to us. Of what existed in the literature of his
age, extremely rich in some branches, entirely empty in others,
Aristotle speaks with extraordinary authority; but Mr G.
Saintsbury has justly remarked that as his criticism of poetry
was injuriously affected by the non-existence of the novelist, so
his criticism of prose was injuriously affected by the omnipresence
of the orator. This continues true of all ancient criticism. A
work by Aristotle on the problems raised by a study of Homer
is lost, and there may have been others of a similar nature; in
the two famous treatises which remain we have nothing less
important than the foundation on which all subsequent European
criticism has been raised. It does not appear that any of the
numerous disciples of Aristotle understood his attitude to literature,
nor do the later philosophical schools offer much of interest.
The Neoplatonists, however, were occupied with analysis of the
Beautiful, on which both Proclus and Plotinus expatiated;
still more purely literary were some of the treatises of Porphyry.
There seems to be no doubt that Alexandria possessed, in the
third century, a vivid school of critic-grammarians; the names
of Zenodotus, of Crates and of Aristarchus were eminent in this
connexion, but of their writings nothing substantial has survived.
They were followed by the scholiasts, and they by the mere
rhetoricians of the last Greek schools, such as Hermogenes and
Aphthonius. In the 2nd century of our era, Dio Chrysostom,
Aristides of Smyrna, and Maximus of Tyre were the main
representatives of criticism, and they were succeeded by Philostratus
and Libanius. The most modern of post-Christian Greek
critics, however, is unquestionably Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
who leads up to Lucian and Cassius Longinus. The last-mentioned
name calls for special notice; in &ldquo;the lovely and
magnificent personality of Longinus&rdquo; we find the most intelligent
judge of literature who wrote between Aristotle and the
moderns. His book <i>On the Sublime</i> (<span class="grk" title="Peri hupsous">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8021;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>), probably
written about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 260, and first printed in 1554, is of extreme
importance, while his intuitions and the splendour of his style
combine to lift Longinus to the highest rank among the critics
of the world.</p>

<p>In Roman literature criticism never took a very prominent
position. In early days the rhetorical works of Cicero and the
famous <i>Art of Poetry</i> of Horace exhaust the category. During the
later Augustan period the only literary critic of importance was
the elder Seneca. Passing over the valuable allusions to the art
of writing in the poets, especially in Juvenal and Martial, we
reach, in the Silver Age, Quintilian, the most accomplished
of all the Roman critics. His <i>Institutes of Oratory</i> has been
described as the fullest and most intelligent application of
criticism to literature which the Latin world produced, and one
which places the name of Quintilian not far below those of
Aristotle and Longinus. He was followed by Aulus Gellius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
by Macrobius (whose reputation was great in the middle ages),
by Servius (the great commentator on Virgil), and, after a long
interval, by Martianus Capella. Latin criticism sank into mere
pedantry about rhetoric and grammar. This continued throughout
the Dark Ages, until the 13th century, when rhythmical treatises,
of which the <i>Labyrinthus</i> of Eberhard (1212?) and the <i>Ars
rhythmica</i> of John of Garlandia (John Garland) are the most
famous, came into fashion. These writings testified to a growing
revival of a taste for poetry.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the masterly technical treatise <i>De vulgari
eloquio</i>, generally attributed to Dante, the first printed (in
Italian) in 1529, that modern poetical criticism takes its first step.
The example of this admirable book was not adequately followed;
throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, criticism is mainly
indirect and accidental. Boccaccio, indeed, is the only figure
worthy of mention, between Dante and Erasmus. With the
Renaissance came a blossoming of Humanist criticism in Italy,
producing such excellent specimens as the <i>Sylvae</i> of Poliziano,
the <i>Poetics</i> (1527) of Vida, and the <i>Poetica</i> of Trissino, the best
of a whole crop of critical works produced, often by famous
names, between 1525 and 1560. These were followed by sounder
scholars and acuter theorists: by Scaliger with his epoch-making
<i>Poetices</i> (1561); by L. Castelvetro, whose <i>Poetica</i> (1570)
started the modern cultivation of the Unities and asserted the
value of the Epic; by Tasso with his <i>Discorsi</i> (1587); and by
Francesco Patrizzi in his <i>Poetica</i> (1586).</p>

<p>In France, the earliest and for a long time the most important
specimen of literary criticism was the <i>Défense et illustration de
la langue française</i>, published in 1549 by Joachim du Bellay.
Ronsard, also, wrote frequently and ably on the art of poetry.
The theories of the Pléiade were summed up in the <i>Art poétique</i>
of Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, which belongs to 1574 (though not
printed until 1605).</p>

<p>In England, the earliest literary critic of importance was
Thomas Wilson, whose <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> was printed in 1553,
and the earliest student of poetry, George Gascoigne, whose
<i>Instruction</i> appeared in 1575. Gascoigne is the first writer
who deals intelligently with the subject of English prosody.
He was followed by Thomas Drant, Harvey, Gosson, Lodge
and Sidney, whose controversial pamphlets belong to the period
between 1575 and 1580. Among Elizabethan &ldquo;arts&rdquo; or &ldquo;defences&rdquo;
of English poetry are to be mentioned those of William
Webbe (1586), George Puttenham (1589), Thomas Campion
(1602), and Samuel Daniel (1603). With the tractates of Ben
Jonson, several of them lost, the criticism of the Renaissance may
be said to close.</p>

<p>A new era began throughout Europe when Malherbe started,
about 1600, a taste for the neo-classic or anti-romantic school
of poetry, taking up the line which had been foreshadowed by
Castelvetro. <i>Enfin Malherbe vint</i>, and he was supported in his
revolution by Regnier, Vaugelas, Balzac, and finally by Corneille
himself, in his famous prefatory discourses. It was Boileau,
however, who more than any other man stood out at the close of
the 17th century as the law-giver of Parnassus. The rules of the
neo-classics were drawn together and arranged in a system by
René Rapin, whose authoritative treatises mainly appeared
between 1668 and 1674. It is in writings of this man, and of
the Jesuits, Le Bossu and Bouhours, that the preposterous
rigidity of the formal classic criticism is most plainly seen. The
influence of these three critics was, however, very great throughout
Europe, and we trace it in the writings of Dryden, Addison
and Rymer. In the course of the 18th century, when the neoclassic
creed was universally accepted, Pope, Blair, Kames,
Harris, Goldsmith and Samuel Johnson were its most distinguished
exponents in England, while Voltaire, Buffon (to
whom we owe the phrase &ldquo;the style is the man&rdquo;), Marmontel,
La Harpe and Suard were the types of academic opinion in
France.</p>

<p>Modern, or more properly Romantic, criticism came in when
the neo-classic tradition became bankrupt throughout Europe
at the very close of the 18th century. It has been heralded in
Germany by the writings of Lessing, and in France by those of
Diderot. Of the reconstruction of critical opinion in the 19th
century it is impossible to speak here with any fulness, it is
contained in the record of the recent literature of each European
language. It is noticeable, in England, that the predominant
place in it was occupied, in violent contrast with Disraeli&rsquo;s
dictum, by those who had obviously <i>not</i> failed in imaginative
composition, by Wordsworth, by Shelley, by Keats, by Landor,
and pre-eminently by S. T. Coleridge, who was one of the most
penetrative, original and imaginative critics who have ever lived.
In France, the importance of Sainte-Beuve is not to be ignored
or even qualified; after manifold changes of taste, he remains
as much a master as he was a precursor. He was followed by
Théophile Gautier, Saint-Marc, Girardin, Paul de Saint Victor,
and a crowd of others, down to Taine and the latest school of
individualistic critics, comparable with Matthew Arnold, Pater,
and their followers in England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRITOLAUS<a name="ar285" id="ar285"></a></span>, Greek philosopher, was born at Phaselis in
the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He lived to the age of eighty-two and died
probably before 111 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He studied philosophy under Aristo
of Ceos and became one of the leaders of the Peripatetic school
by his eminence as an orator, a scholar and a moralist. There
has been considerable discussion as to whether he was the
immediate successor of Aristo, but the evidence is confused and
unprofitable. In general he was a loyal adherent to the Peripatetic
succession (cf. Cicero, <i>De fin.</i> v. 5 &ldquo;C. imitari antiquos
voluit&rdquo;), though in some respects he went beyond his predecessors.
For example, he held that pleasure is an evil (Gellius, <i>Noctes
Atticae</i>, ix. 5. 6), and definitely maintained that the soul consists
of aether. The end of existence was to him the general perfection
of the natural life, including the goods of the soul and the body,
and also external goods. Cicero says in the <i>Tusculans</i> that the
goods of the soul entirely outweighed for him the other goods
(&ldquo;tantum propendere illam bonorum animi lancem&rdquo;). Further,
he defended against the Stoics the Peripatetic doctrine of the
eternity of the world and the indestructibility of the human race.
There is no observed change in the natural order of things;
mankind re-creates itself in the same manner according to the
capacity given by Nature, and the various ills to which it is
heir, though fatal to individuals, do not avail to modify the
whole. Just as it is absurd to suppose that man is merely
earth-born, so the possibility of his ultimate destruction is
inconceivable. The world, as the manifestation of eternal order,
must itself be immortal. The life of Critolaus is not recorded.
One incident alone is preserved. From Cicero (<i>Acad.</i> ii. 45) it
appears that he was sent with Carneades and Diogenes to Rome
in 156-155 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to protest against the fine of 500 talents imposed
on Athens in punishment for the sack of Oropus. The three
ambassadors lectured on philosophy in Rome with so much
success that Cato was alarmed and had them dismissed the
city. Gellius describes his arguments as <i>scita et teretia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CRITTENDEN, JOHN JORDAN<a name="ar286" id="ar286"></a></span> (1787-1863), American
statesman, was born in Versailles, Kentucky, on the 10th of
September 1787. After graduating at the College of William
and Mary in 1807, he began the practice of law in his native
state. He served for three months, in 1810, as attorney-general
of Illinois Territory, but soon returned to Kentucky, and during
the War of 1812 he was for a time on the staff of General Isaac
Shelby. In 1811-1817 he served in the state House of Representatives,
being speaker in 1815-1816, and in 1817-1819 was a
United States senator. Settling in Frankfort, he soon took high
rank as a criminal lawyer, was in the Kentucky House of Representatives
in 1825 and 1829-1832, acting as speaker in the latter
period, and from 1827 to 1829 was United States district-attorney.
He was removed by President Jackson, to whom he was radically
opposed. In 1835, as a Whig, he was again elected to the United
States Senate, and was re-elected in 1841, but resigned to enter
the cabinet of President W. H. Harrison as attorney-general,
continuing after President Tyler&rsquo;s accession and serving from
March until September. He was again a member of the United
States Senate from 1842 to 1848, and in 1848-1850 was governor
of Kentucky. He was an ardent and outspoken supporter of
Clay&rsquo;s compromise measures, and in 1850 he entered President
Fillmore&rsquo;s cabinet as attorney-general, serving throughout the
administration. From 1855 to 1861 he was once more a member
of the United States Senate. During these years he was perhaps
the foremost champion of Union in the South, and strenuously
opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which he declared prophetically
would unite the various elements of opposition in the
North, and render the breach between the sections irreparable.
Nevertheless he laboured unceasingly in the cause of compromise,
gave his strong support to the Bell and Everett ticket
in 1860, and in 1860-1861 proposed and vainly contended for
the adoption by congress of the compromise measures which bear
his name. When war became inevitable he threw himself
zealously into the Union cause, and lent his great influence to
keep Kentucky in the Union. In 1861-1863 he was a member
of the national House of Representatives, where, while advocating
the prosecution of the war, he opposed such radical measures
as the division of Virginia, the enlistment of slaves and the
Conscription Acts. He died at Frankfort, Kentucky, on the
26th of July 1863.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">George Bibb Crittenden</span> (1812-1880), soldier, was
born in Russellville, Kentucky, on the 20th of March 1812, and
graduated at West Point in 1832, but resigned his commission
in 1833. He re-entered the army as a captain of mounted rifles
in the Mexican War, served with distinction, and was breveted
major for bravery at Contreras and Churubusco. After the
war he remained in the army, and in 1856 attained the rank
of lieutenant-colonel. In June 1861 he resigned, and entered
the service of the Confederacy. He was commissioned major-general
and given a command in south-east Kentucky and
Tennessee, but after the defeat of his forces by General George H.
Thomas at Mill Springs (January 9, 1862), he was censured and
gave up his command. He served subsequently as a volunteer
aide on the staff of Gen. John S. Williams. From 1867 to 1871
he was state librarian of Kentucky. He died at Danville,
Kentucky, on the 27th of November 1880.</p>

<p>Another son, <span class="sc">Thomas Leonidas Crittenden</span> (1815-1893),
soldier, was also born at Russellville, Kentucky. He studied
law, and practised with his father, and in 1842 became commonwealth&rsquo;s
attorney. He served in the Mexican War as a lieutenant-colonel
of Kentucky volunteers, and was an aide on Gen. Zachary
Taylor&rsquo;s staff at the battle of Buena Vista. From 1849 to
1853 he was United States consul at Liverpool, England. Like
his father, he was a strong Union man, and in September 1861
he was commissioned by President Lincoln a brigadier-general
of volunteers. He commanded a division at Shiloh, for gallantry
in which battle he was promoted major-general in July 1862.
He was in command of a corps in the army of the Ohio under
Gen. D. C. Buell, and took part in the battles of Stone River
and Chickamauga. Subsequently he served in the Virginia
campaign of 1864. He resigned his commission in December
1864, but in July 1866 entered the regular army with the rank
of colonel of infantry, receiving the brevet of brigadier-general
in 1867, served on the frontier and in several Indian wars, and
retired in 1881. He died on the 23rd of October 1893.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CRIVELLI, CARLO<a name="ar287" id="ar287"></a></span>, Venetian painter, was born in the earlier
part of the 15th century. The only dates that can with certainty
be given are 1468 and 1493; these are respectively the earliest
and the latest years signed on his pictures&mdash;the former on an
altar-piece in the church of San Silvestro at Massa near Fermo,
and the latter on a picture in the Oggioni collection in Milan.
Though born in Venice, Crivelli seems to have worked chiefly
in the March of Ancona, and especially in and near Ascoli;
there are only two pictures of his proper to a Venetian building,
both of these being in the church of San Sebastiano. He is said
to have studied under Jacobello del Fiore, who was painting as
late at any rate as 1436; at that time Crivelli was probably only
a boy. The latter always signed as &ldquo;Carolus Crivellus Venetus&rdquo;;
from 1490 he added &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; having been then knighted
(&ldquo;Cavalière&rdquo;) by Ferdinand II. of Naples. He painted in
tempera only, and is seen to most advantage in subject pictures
of moderate size. He introduced agreeable landscape backgrounds;
and was particularly partial to giving fruits and
flowers (the peach is one of his favourite fruits) as accessories,
often in pendent festoons. The National Gallery in London is
well supplied with examples of Crivelli; the &ldquo;Annunciation,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Beato Ferretti&rdquo; (of the same family as Pope Pius IX.)
in religious ecstasy, may be specified. Another of his principal
pictures is in San Francesco di Matelica; in Berlin is a
&ldquo;Madonna and Saints&rdquo; (1491); in the Vatican Gallery a &ldquo;Dead
Christ,&rdquo; and in the Brera of Milan the painter&rsquo;s own portrait,
with other examples. Crivelli is a painter of marked individuality,&mdash;hard
in form, crudely definite in contour; stern, forced,
energetic, almost grotesque and repellent, in feature and expression,
and yet well capable of a prim sort of prettiness; simply
vigorous in his effect of detachment and relief, and sometimes
admitting into his pictures objects actually raised in surface;
distinct and warm in colour, with an effect at once harsh and
harmonious. His pictures gain by being seen in half-light, and
at some little distance; under favouring conditions they grip
the spectator with uncommon power. Few artists seem to have
worked with more uniformity of purpose, or more forthright
command of his materials, so far as they go. It is surmised that
Carlo was of the same family as the painters Donato Crivelli
(who was working in 1459, and was also a scholar of Jacobello)
and Vittorio Crivelli. Pietro Alamanni was his pupil.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CROATIA-SLAVONIA<a name="ar288" id="ar288"></a></span> (Serbo-Croatian <i>Hrvatska i Slavonija</i>;
Hung. <i>Horvát-Szlavonország</i>; Ger. <i>Kroatien und Slawonien</i>), a
kingdom of the Hungarian monarchy; bounded on the N. by
Carniola, Styria and Hungary proper; E. by Hungary and
Servia; S. by Servia, Bosnia and Dalmatia; and W. by the
Adriatic Sea, Istria and Carniola. Until 1881 Croatia, in the
N.W. of this region, was divided from Slavonia, in the N.E., by
a section of the Austrian Military Frontier. This section is now
the county of Bjelovar, and forms part of the united kingdom
of Croatia-Slavonia. The river Kulpa, which bisects the county
of Agram, is usually regarded as the north-eastern limit of the
Balkan Peninsula; and thus the greater part of Croatia, lying
south of this river, falls within the peninsular boundary, while
the remainder, with all Slavonia, belongs to the continental
mainland. According to the official survey of 1900, the total
area of the country is 16,423 sq. m. The Croatian littoral extends
for about 90 m. from Fiume to the Dalmatian frontier. A
narrow strait, the Canale della Morlacca (or della Montagna),
separates it from Veglia, Arbe, Pago and other Istrian or Dalmatian
islands. The city and territories of Fiume, the sole
important harbour on this coast, are included in Hungary proper,
and controlled by the Budapest government. Westward from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
Warasdin, and along the borders of Styria, Carniola, Istria,
Dalmatia and north-western Bosnia, the frontier is generally
mountainous and follows an irregular course. The central and
eastern region, situated between the Drave and Danube on the
north, and the Save on the south, forms one long wedge, with its
point at Semlin.</p>

<p><i>Physical Features</i>.&mdash;Croatia-Slavonia is naturally divided
into two great sections, the highlands of the west and the lowlands
of the east.</p>

<p>The plateau of the Istrian Karst is prolonged in several of
the bare and desolate mountain chains between the Save and
the Adriatic, notably the Great and Little Kapella (or Kapela),
which link together the Karst and the Dinaric Alps, culminating
in Biela La&#382;ica (5029 ft.); the Plje&#353;evica or Pli&#353;evica Planina
(5410 ft.), overlooking the valley of the river Una; and the
Velebit Planina, which follows the westward curve of the coast,
and rises above the sea in an abrupt wall, unbroken by any
considerable bay or inlet. As it skirts the Dalmatian border,
this range attains its greatest altitude in the adjacent peaks of
Sveto Brdo (5751 ft.), and Vakanski Vrh (5768 ft.). Large
tracts of the Croatian highlands are well-nigh waterless, and it
is only in the more sheltered hollows that sufficient soil collects
for large trees to flourish. In northern Croatia and Slavonia
the mountains are far more fertile, being often densely wooded
with oaks, beeches and pines. They comprise the Uskoken
Gebirge, or Uskoks Mountains, named after the piratical Uskoks
(<i>q.v.</i>) of Zengg, who were deported hither after the fall of their
stronghold in 1617; the Warasdin Mountains, with the peak
of Ivansci&#269;a (3478 ft.); the Agram Mountains, culminating in
Sljeme or Slema (3396 ft.), and including the beautiful stretches
of Alpine pasture known as the Zagorje, or &ldquo;land beyond the
hills&rdquo;; the Bilo Gebirge, or White Mountains, a low range of
chalk, and, farther to the south, several groups of mountains,
among which Psunj (3228 ft.), Papuk (3217 ft.) Crni Vrh (2833
ft.), and the Ravna Gora (2808 ft.) are the chief summits. All
these ranges, except the Uskoken Gebirge, constitute the central
watershed of the kingdom, between the Drave and Save. In
the east Slavonian county of Syrmia<a name="FnAnchor_1q" id="FnAnchor_1q" href="#Footnote_1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the Fru&#353;ka Gora or
Vrdnik Mountains rise to a height of 1768 ft. along the southern
bank of the Danube, their picturesque vineyards and pine or
oak woods contrasting strongly with the plains that surround
them.</p>

<p>The lowlands, in the valleys of the Drave, Danube, Save and
Kulpa, belong partly to the great Hungarian Plains, or Alföld.
Besides the sterile and monotonous steppes, valuable only as
pasture, and so sparsely populated that it is possible to travel
for many hours without encountering any sign of human life
except a primitive artesian well or a shepherd&rsquo;s hut, there are
wide expanses of fen-country, regularly flooded in spring and
autumn. The marshes which line the Save below Sissek are
often impassable except at Brod and Mitrovica, and the river
is constantly scooping out fresh channels in the soft soil, only to
abandon each in turn. The total area liable to yearly inundation
exceeds 200 sq. m. But along the Drave and Danube the plains
are sometimes strikingly fertile, and yield an abundance of grain,
fruit and wine.</p>

<p>The main rivers of Croatia-Slavonia, the Danube, Drave
and Save, are fully described under separate headings. After
reaching Croatian territory 13 m. N.W. of Warasdin, the Drave
flows along the northern frontier for 155 m., receiving the
Bednja and Karasnica on the right, and falling, near Esseg,
into the Danube, which serves as the Hungaro-Slavonian
boundary for an additional 116 m. The Save enters the country
16 m. W. of Agram, and, after winding for 106 m. S.E. to Jasenovac,
constitutes the southern frontier for 253 m., and meets
the Danube at Belgrade. It is joined by the Sotla, Krapina,
Lonja, Ilova, Pakra and Oljana, which drain the central watershed;
but its only large tributaries are the Una, a Bosnian
stream, which springs in the Dinaric Alps, and skirts the Croatian
border for 40 m. before entering the Save at Jasenovac; and
the Kulpa, which follows a tortuous course of 60 m. from its
headwaters north of Fiume, to its confluence with the Save at
Sissek. The Mre&#382;nica, Dobra, Glina and Korana are right-hand
tributaries of the Kulpa. In the Croatian Karst the seven
streams of the Lika unite and plunge into a rocky chasm near
Gospi&#263;, and the few small brooks of this region usually vanish
underground in a similar manner. Near Fiume, the Recina,
Rjeka or Fiumara falls into the Adriatic after a brief course.
There is no large lake in Croatia-Slavonia, but the upland pools
and waterfalls of Plitvica, near Ogulin, are celebrated for their
beauty. After a thaw or heavy rain, the subterranean rivers
flood the mountain hollows of the Karst; and a lake thus formed
by the river Gajka, near Oto&#269;ac, has occasionally filled its basin
to a depth of 160 ft.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Minerals</i>.&mdash;The mineral resources of the kingdom, though capable
of further development, are not rich. They are chiefly confined to
the mountains, where iron, coal, copper, lead, zinc, silver and
sulphur are mined in small quantities. Warm mineral springs rise
at Krapina, at Toplice near Warasdin, at Stubica near Agram, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The climate of Croatia-Slavonia varies greatly in
different regions. In the Karst it is liable to sudden and violent
changes, and especially to the <i>bora</i>, a fierce N.N.E. wind, which
renders navigation perilous among the islands off the coast, and, in
winter, blocks the roads and railway-cuttings with deep snowdrifts.
The sheltered bays near Fiume enjoy an equable climate; but in all
other districts the temperature in mid-winter falls regularly below
zero, and the summer heats are excessive. Earthquakes are common
among the mountains, and the eastern lowlands are exposed to the
great winds and sandstorms which sweep down the Alföld. At
Agram, during the years 1896-1900, the mean annual temperature
was 52° F., with 34.6 in. of rain and snow; at Fiume, the figures
for the same period were 57° and 71 in.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;The agricultural inquiry of 1895 showed that 94.5%
of the country consisted of arable land, gardens, vineyards, meadows,
pastures and forests; but much of this area must be set down as
mountainous and swampy pasture of poor quality. The richest land
occurs in the Zagorje and its neighbourhood, in the hills near Warasdin
and in the northern half of Syrmia. The Karst and the fens are
of least agricultural value. Indian corn heads the list of cereals,
but wheat, oats, rye and barley are also cultivated, besides hemp,
flax, tobacco and large quantities of potatoes. The extensive vineyards
were much injured by <i>phylloxera</i> towards the close of the
19th century. The Slavonian plum orchards furnish dried prunes,
besides a kind of brandy largely exported under the name of <i>sliwowitz</i>
or <i>shlivovitsa</i>. Near Fiume the orange, lemon, pomegranate, fig
and olive bear well; mulberries are planted on many estates for
silkworms; and the heather-clad uplands of the central region
favour the keeping of bees. Large herds of swine fatten in the oak
and beech forests; and dairy-farming is a thriving industry in the
highlands between Agram and Warasdin, where, during the last
years of the 19th century, systematic attempts were made to replace
the mountain pastures by clover and sown grass. The proportion
of sheep to other live-stock is lower than in most of the South Slavonic
lands, and the scarcity of goats is also noteworthy. Horsebreeding
is a favourite pursuit in Slavonia; and between 1900 and 1902
many thousands of remounts were shipped to the British army in
South Africa. The local administration endeavours to better the
quality of live-stock by importing purer breeds, distributing prizes,
and other measures; but the native farmers are slow to accept
improvements.</p>

<p><i>Forests</i>.&mdash;Forests, principally of oak, pine and beech, covered
3,734,000 acres in 1895, about one-fifth being state property. Especially
valuable are the Croatian oak-forests, near Agram and Sissek.
Timber is exported from Fiume and down the Danube.</p>

<p><i>Industries</i>.&mdash;Apart from the distilleries and breweries scattered
throughout the country, the rude flour-mills which lie moored in the
rivers, and a few glass-works, saw-mills, silk-mills and tobacco
factories, the chief industrial establishments of Croatia-Slavonia
are at Agram, Fiume, Semlin, Buccari and Porto Ré. Only 8.3 of
the population was, in 1900, engaged in industries other than
farming, which occupied 85.2%. The exports mainly consist of
foodstuffs, especially grain, of live-stock, especially pigs and horses,
and of timber. The imports include textiles, iron, coal, wine and
colonial products; with machinery and other finished articles.
Goods in transit to and from Hungary figure largely in the official
returns for Fiume<a name="FnAnchor_2q" id="FnAnchor_2q" href="#Footnote_2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and Semlin, which are the centres of the
foreign trade. In 1900 Croatia-Slavonia possessed 253 banking
establishments.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;The commerce of the country is furthered by
upwards of 2000 m. of carriage-roads, the most remarkable of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
being the Maria Louisa, which connects Karlstadt with Fiume, and
the Josephina, which passes inland from Zengg. Many excellent
highways were built for strategic purposes before the abolition of
the Military Frontier in 1881. The railways, which are all owned
and managed by the Hungarian state, intersect most parts of the
country except the mountains south of Ogulin, where there is,
nevertheless, a considerable traffic over the passes into Dalmatia
and Bosnia. Agram is the principal railway centre, from which
lines radiate S. W. to Fiume, W. into Austria, N.N.E. to Warasdin
and into Hungary, and S.E. into Bosnia by way of Kostajnica.
The main line eastward from Agram passes through Brod, where it
meets the Bosnian system, and on to Belgrade; throwing out two
branch lines to Br&#269;ka and &#352;amac in Bosnia, and several branches
on the north, which traverse the central watershed, and cross the
Hungarian frontier at Zákány, Barcs, Esseg, Erdar and Peterwardein.
Above Agram the Save is used chiefly for floating rafts of timber;
east of Sissek it is navigable by small steamboats, but, despite its
great volume, the multitude of its perpetually shifting sandbanks
interferes greatly with traffic. Steamers also ply on the Una, the
Drave below Barcs, and the Danube. The marshes of Syrmia are
partially drained by the so-called &ldquo;Canal of Probus,&rdquo; the one large
artificial waterway in the country, said to have been cut by the
Romans in the 3rd century.</p>

<p><i>Chief Towns</i>,&mdash;The principal towns are Agram, the capital,
with 61,002 inhabitants in 1900; Esseg, the capital of Slavonia
(24,930); Semlin (15,079); Mitrovica (11,518); Warasdin (12,930);
Karlstadt (7396); Brod (7310); Sissek (7047); Djakovo (6824);
Karlowitz (5643); Peterwardein (5019); Zengg (3182); and
Buccari (1870). These are described in separate articles. The
centre of the coasting trade is Novi, and other small seaports are
San Giorgio (<i>Sveto Juraj</i>), Porto Ré (<i>Kraljevica</i>) and Carlopago.
Agram, Gospi&#263; (10,799), Ogulin (8699), Warasdin and Bjelovar
(6056) are respectively the capitals of the five counties which belong
to Croatia proper,&mdash;Agram (Hung. <i>Zágráb</i>), Modru&#353;-Fiume, Lika-Krbava,
Warasdin (<i>Varasd</i>) and Bjelovar (<i>Belovár-Körös</i>); while
the capitals of the three Slavonian counties, Virovitica (<i>Veröcze</i>),
Po&#382;ega (<i>Pozsega</i>) and Syrmia (<i>Szerém</i>), are Esseg, Po&#382;ega (5000)
and Semlin.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population and National Characteristics</i>.&mdash;The population rose
from 1,892,499 in 1881 to 2,416,304 in 1900, an increase of
little less than one-third, resulting from a uniformly low death
rate, with a high marriage and birth rate, and characterized
by that preponderance of male over female children which is
common to all the South Slavonic lands. More than 75% of the
inhabitants are Croats, the bulk of the remainder being Serbs,
who predominate in eastern Slavonia. Outside Croatia-Slavonia,
the Croats occupy the greater part of Dalmatia and northern
Bosnia. There are large Croatian settlements in the south of
Hungary, and smaller colonies in Austria. The numbers of the
whole nation may be estimated at 3,500,000 or 4,000,000. The
distinction between Croats and Serbs is religious, and, to a less
extent, linguistic. Croats and Serbs together constitute a single
branch of the Slavonic race, frequently called the Serbo-Croatian
branch. The literary language of the two nations is identical,
but the Croats use the Latin alphabet,<a name="FnAnchor_3q" id="FnAnchor_3q" href="#Footnote_3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a> while the Serbs prefer
a modified form of the Cyrillic. The two nations have also been
politically separated since the 7th century, if not for a longer
period; but this division has produced little difference of
character or physical type. Even the costume of the Croatian
peasantry, to whom brilliant colours and intricate embroideries
are always dear, proclaims their racial identity with the Serbs;
their songs, dances and musical instruments, the chief part of
their customs and folk-lore, their whole manner of life, so little
changed by its closer contact with Western civilization, may
be studied in Servia (<i>q.v.</i>) itself. In both countries rural society
was based on the old-fashioned household community, or <i>zadruga</i>,
which still survives in the territories that formed the Military
Frontier, though everywhere tending to disappear and be
replaced by individual ownership. The Croatian peasantry
are least prosperous in the riverside districts, where marsh-fevers
prevail, and especially beside the Save. Even in many
of the towns the houses are mere cabins of wood and thatch.
As in Servia, there is practically no middle class between the
peasants and the educated minority; and the commercial
element consists to a great extent of foreigners, especially
Germans, Hungarians, Italians and Jews. Numerically this
alien population is insignificant. The Italians are chiefly
confined to the coast; the Germans congregate at Semlin and
Warasdin; the Slovenes are settled along the north-western
frontier, where they have introduced their language, and so
greatly modified the local dialect; the gipsies wander from city
to city, as horse-dealers, metal workers or musicians; there are
numerous Moravian and Bohemian settlements; and near
Mitrovica there is a colony of Albanians. It is impossible to
give accurate statistics of the alien population; for, in the
compilation of the official figures, language is taken as a test
of nationality, an utterly untrustworthy method in a country
where every educated person speaks two or three languages.
Croatian nationalists also maintain that official figures are
systematically altered in the Hungarian interest.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Government</i>.&mdash;By the fundamental law of the
21st of December 1867 Austria-Hungary was divided, for purposes
of internal government, into Cisleithania, or the Austrian
empire, and Transleithania, or the kingdoms of Hungary and
Croatia-Slavonia. In theory the viceroy, or <i>ban</i> of Croatia-Slavonia
is nominated by the crown, and enjoys almost unlimited
authority over local affairs; in practice the consent of the crown
is purely formal, and the <i>ban</i> is appointed by the Hungarian
premier, who can dismiss him at any moment. The provincial
government is subject to the <i>ban</i>, and comprises three ministries&mdash;the
interior, justice, and religion and education,&mdash;for whose
working the <i>ban</i> is responsible to the Hungarian premier, and to
the national assembly of Croatia-Slavonia (<i>Narodna Skup&#353;tina</i>).
This body consists of a single chamber, composed partly of
elected deputies, partly of privileged members, whose numbers
cannot exceed half those of the deputies. There are 69 constituencies,
besides the 21 royal free cities which also return
deputies. Electors must belong to certain professions or pay a
small tax. The privileged members are the heads of the nobility,
with the highest ecclesiastics and officials. As a rule, they
represent the &ldquo;Magyarist&rdquo; section of society, which sympathizes
with Hungarian policy. The chamber deals with religion,
education, justice and certain strictly provincial affairs, but
even within this limited sphere all its important enactments
must be countersigned by the minister for Croatia-Slavonia,
a member, without portfolio, of the Hungarian cabinet. At
the polls, all votes are given orally, a system which facilitates
corruption; the officials who control the elections depend for
their livelihood on the <i>ban</i>, usually a Magyarist; and thus,
even apart from the privileged members, a majority favourable
to Hungary can usually be secured. The constitutional relations
between Hungary and Croatia-Slavonia are regulated by the
agreement, or <i>nagoda</i>, of 1868. This instrument determines the
functions of the <i>ban</i>; the control of common interests, such as
railways, posts, telegraphs, telephones, commerce, industry,
agriculture or forests; and the choice of delegates by the
chamber, to sit in the Hungarian parliament. See also below,
under <i>History</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For administrative purposes Croatia-Slavonia is divided into 8
rural counties, already enumerated; besides the 4 urban counties,
or municipalities of Agram, Semlin, Warasdin and Esseg.
These are subdivided into rural and urban communes,
<span class="sidenote">Local administration.</span>
each with its representative council. The affairs of each
rural county are managed by an assembly chosen for 6
years, which comprises not only elected members, but delegates
from all the cities except Agram and Esseg, with certain high
ecclesiastics and officials.</p>

<p>The highest judicial authority is the supreme court or Septemviral
Table, which sits at Agram, and ranks above the royal
<span class="sidenote">Justice.</span>
courts of appeal, the county courts of first instance,
and the district courts or magistracies.</p>

<p>Fully four-fifths of the population belong to the Roman Catholic
Church, which has an archbishop at Agram and bishops at Zengg
and Djakovo. There are about 12,000 Greek Catholics,
with a bishop at Kreuz (<i>Kri&#382;evac</i>). The Serb congregations,
<span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>
who had previously been classed as Orthodox Greek, were
officially recognized as members of the Orthodox Church of Servia
after 1883. Their episcopal sees of Karlowitz and Pakrac depend
upon the metropolitanate of Belgrade; but from 1830 to 1838
Karlowitz was itself the headquarters of the Servian Church.</p>

<p>During the 19th century strenuous efforts to better the state of
education were made by Bishop Strossmayer (1815-1905) and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
reformers; but, although some success was achieved, only one-third
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
of the population could read and write in 1900. Foremost among the
educational institutions is the South Slavonic Academy
of Sciences and Arts (<i>Jugoslavenska Akademija Znanosti
i Umjetnosti</i>), founded by Strossmayer and others in
1867, as an improvement on a learned society which had existed
since 1836. The academy is the headquarters of the nationalist
propaganda. Its numerous publications, though sometimes biased
by political passion, throw much light on Serbo-Croatian history,
law, philology and kindred topics. Agram University, founded in
1874, possesses three faculties&mdash;theology, philosophy and law;
but, unlike other Hungarian universities, it lacks a faculty of medicine.
Its average number of students varies from 300 to 350. In
1900 there were also 19 <i>real-gymnasia</i>, teaching science, art and
modern languages, as well as classics and mathematics; 1400
elementary schools; and a few special institutions, such as the naval
and military academies of Fiume, ecclesiastical seminaries and
commercial colleges. In almost every case the language of instruction
is Serbo-Croatian. The development of higher education,
without a corresponding advance of technical education, has created
an intellectual class, comprising many men of letters, and several
painters, musicians and sculptors, though none of great eminence;
it also tends to produce many aspirants to official or professional
careers, who find employment difficult to obtain. The want of a
strong native middle class may partly be traced to this tendency.</p>
</div>

<p class="center pt2"><i>History.</i></p>

<p>Medieval historians did not use the terms Croatia and Slavonia
in their present sense. The Croatia of the middle ages comprised
north-western Bosnia, Turkish Croatia, and the region now
known as Upper Croatia. The whole country between the Drave
and Save, thus including a large part of modern Croatia, was
called in Latin <i>Slavonia</i>, in German <i>Windisches Land</i>, and in
Hungarian <i>Tótország</i>, to distinguish it from the territories in
which the Croats were racially supreme (<i>Horvátország</i>). At the
time of their conquest by the Romans (35 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) both these
divisions were occupied by the Pannonians, who in Slavonia had
displaced an older population, the Scordisci; and both were
included in the Roman province of Pannonia Inferior, although
Slavonia had the distinctive name of Pannonia Savia (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pannonia</a></span>). When the Roman dominions were broken up in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 395, Croatia-Slavonia remained part of the Western empire.
The Ostrogoths overran it in 489; in 535 it was annexed by
Justinian; in 568 it was conquered by the Avars. These were
in turn expelled from Croatia by the Croats, a Slavonic people
from the western Carpathians, who, according to some authorities,
had occupied the territories of the Marcomanni in Bohemia,
and been driven thence in the 6th century by the Czechs. The
main body of the Croats, whose tribal and racial names respectively
are perpetuated in the names of Croatia and Slavonia,
entered Croatia between 634 and 638, and were encouraged by
the emperor Heraclius to attack the Avars. Smaller bodies had
led the way southwards since 548. The Croats formed the
western division of the great migratory horde of Serbo-Croats
which colonized the lands between Bulgaria and the Adriatic.
Contemporary chroniclers called them <i>Chrobati</i>, <i>Belochrobati</i>
(&ldquo;White Croats&rdquo;), <i>Chrovati</i>, <i>Horvati</i>, or by some similar Latin
or Byzantine variant of the Slavonic <i>Khrvaty</i>. The Croats
occupied most of the region now known as Croatia-Slavonia,
Dalmatia, and north-western Bosnia, displacing or absorbing
the earlier inhabitants everywhere except along the Dalmatian
littoral, where the Italian city-states usually maintained their
independence, and in certain districts of Slavonia, where, out
of a mixed population of Slavonic immigrants, Avars and
Pannonians, the Slavs, and especially the Serbo-Croats, gradually
became predominant. The Croats brought with them their
primitive tribal institutions, organized on a basis partly military,
partly patriarchal, and identical with the Zhupanates of the
Serbs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Servia</a></span>); agriculture, war and hunting were their
chief pursuits. Although they at first acknowledged no alien
sovereign, they passed gradually under Italian influence in the
extreme west, and under Byzantine influence in the south and
south-east. In 806 the northern and north-eastern districts
were added to the empire of the Franks, and thus won for the
Western Church. Frankish predominance was long commemorated
by the name Francochorion, given by the Byzantines
to Syrmia; it is still commemorated by the name Fru&#353;ka Gora,
&ldquo;Mountains of the Franks,&rdquo; in that province.</p>

<p><i>The Croatian Kingdom: c. 910-1091.</i>&mdash;In 877 the Croats
were temporarily subdued by the Byzantine emperor, but after
successive insurrections which tended to centralize their loosely
knit tribal organization, and to place all power in the hands of
a military chief, they regained their independence and founded
a national kingdom about 910. It is probable that Tomislav or
Timislav, who had led their armies to victory, assumed the title
of king in that year. Some authorities, however, state that
Tomislav only bore the title of <i>veliki &#382;upan</i> or &ldquo;paramount chief,&rdquo;
and was only one in a long line of princes which can be traced
without interruption back to 818. On this view, Dr&#382;islav
(c. 978-1000) was the first king properly so called. But Tomislav,
whatever his official style, was certainly the first of a series of
independent national rulers which lasted for nearly two centuries.
The records of this period, regarded by many Croats as the golden
age of their country, are often scanty, and its chronology is still
unsettled. Little is known of Trpimir, who preceded Dr&#382;islav,
or of Stephen I. (1035-1058), but a few of the kings gained a more
lasting fame by their success in war and diplomacy. Among
these were Kre&#353;imir I. (c. 940&mdash;946), his successor Miroslav, and
especially Kre&#353;imir II., surnamed the Great (c. 1000-1035),
who harried the Bulgarians, at that time a powerful nation, and
conquered a large part of Dalmatia, including some of the
Italian cities. Already, under his predecessors, the Croats had
built a fleet, which they used first for piracy and afterwards for
trade. Their skill in maritime affairs, exemplified first in the
9th century by the pagan corsairs of the Narenta (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dalmatia</a></span>:
<i>History</i>), and later by the numerous Dalmatian and Croatian
sailors who served in the navies of Venice and Austria, is remarkable
in a Slavonic people, and one which had so recently migrated
from central Europe. At the end of the 10th century they even
for a short period exacted tribute from Venice, but their power
was temporarily destroyed in 1000, when the Venetians captured
and sacked Biograd or Belgrade, the Italian Zaravecchia. This
Dalmatian port was not only the Croatian arsenal, but the seat
of the kings, who here sought to enhance their dignity by borrowing
the grandiose titles and elaborate procedure of the Byzantine
court. Kre&#353;imir II. and Kre&#353;imir Peter (c. 1058-1073), the hero
of many national legends and lays, restored the naval power of
the Croats. After the death of Kre&#353;imir Peter, Slavic or Slavi&#382;a
reigned until 1076, when he was succeeded by Zvonimir (Svinimir
or Zvoinimir) Demetrius. Zvonimir was crowned by the legate
of Pope Gregory VII, and appears to have been regarded as a
vassal of the papacy. Both he and Stephen II., a nephew of
Kre&#353;imir II., died in 1089.</p>

<p><i>Hungarian Supremacy: 1091-c. 1526.</i>&mdash;Amid the strife of
rival claimants to the throne, Helena, the widow of Stephen,
appealed for aid to her brother Ladislaus I., king of Hungary.
Ladislaus took possession of the country in 1091. He founded
the bishopric of Agram and introduced Hungarian law. His
death in 1095 was the signal for a nationalist insurrection, but
after two years the rebels were crushed by his successor Coloman.
This monarch reorganized the administration on a system which
has been maintained, with modifications in detail, by almost
all subsequent rulers. He respected the existing institutions of
the conquered territory so far as to leave its autonomy in domestic
affairs intact; but delegated his own sovereignty, and especially
the control of foreign affairs and war, to a governor known as
the ban (<i>q.v.</i>). This office was sometimes held by princes of
the royal house, often by Croatian nobles. Coloman also
extended his authority over Dalmatia and the islands of the
Quarnero, but the best modern authorities reject the tradition
that in 1102 he was crowned king of Croatia, Slavonia and
Dalmatia. In 1127 Syrmia, which had been annexed to Bulgaria
from about 700 to 1018, and to the Eastern empire from 1019,
was united to Slavonia. The Hungarian government left much
liberty to the Croatian nobles, a turbulent and fanatical class,
ever ready for civil war, rebellion or a campaign against the
Bosnian heretics. Their most powerful leaders were the counts
of Zrin and Bribir (or Brebir), whose surname was &#352;ubi&#263;. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>
family played an important part in local politics from the 13th
century to 1670, when Peter &#352;ubi&#263; was its last member to hold
the office of ban. Paul &#352;ubi&#263; (d. 1312) and Mladen &#352;ubi&#263; (d. 1322)
even for a short period united Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia and part
of Dalmatia under their own rule. From 1322 to 1326 the
Croatian nobles successfully withstood the armies of Hungary
and Bosnia; from 1337 to 1340, instigated by the Vatican, they
carried on a crusade against the Bosnian Bogomils; and in the
Krajina (Turkish Croatia) hostilities were resumed at intervals
until the Turkish conquest.</p>

<p><i>The Turkish Occupation: c. 1526-1718.</i>&mdash;Here, as elsewhere,
the Ottoman invasion was facilitated by the feuds of the Christian
sects. When King Matthias Corvinus undertook to defend
Slavonia in 1490 it was too late; Matthias lost Syrmia and died
in the same year. His successor Ladislaus of Poland (1490-1516)
added Slavonia to the kingdoms named in the royal title, which
now included the words &ldquo;King of Dalmatia and Croatia and
Slavonia&rdquo; (<i>Rex Dalmatiae et Croatiae et Slavoniae</i>). But he
failed to repel the Turks, who in 1526 destroyed the power of
Hungary at the battle of Mohács. In 1527 the Croats were
compelled to swear allegiance to Ferdinand I. of Austria, who
had been elected king of Hungary. Ferdinand founded the
generalcy of Karlstadt and thus laid the foundation of the
military frontier. The provinces of Agram, Warasdin and
Kreutz, previously included in Slavonia, were added to Croatia,
to counterbalance the loss of territory in the Krajina. Throughout
the century the Turks continued to extend their conquests
until, in 1606, the emperor retained only western Croatia, with
the cities of Agram, Karlstadt, Warasdin and Zengg. During
the same period the doctrines of the Reformation had spread
among the Croats; but they were forcibly suppressed in 1607-1610.
The military occupation by the Turks left little permanent
impression; colonization was never attempted; and the
continuous wars by which the victors strove to secure or enlarge
their dominions north of the Save left no time for the introduction
of Moslem religion or civilization among the vanquished. Thus
in the reconquest of Croatia-Slavonia there was none of the
local opposition which afterwards hindered the Austrian occupation
of Bosnia. The successes of Prince Eugene in 1697 led
two years later to the peace of Carlowitz, by which the Turks
ceded the greater part of Slavonia and Hungary to Austria;
and the remainder was surrendered in 1718 by the treaty of
Passarowitz. Only Turkish Croatia henceforth remained part of
the Ottoman empire.</p>

<p><i>Austrian and French Supremacy: 1718-1814.</i>&mdash;Austrian
influence predominated throughout Croatia-Slavonia during
most of the 18th century, although Slavonia was constitutionally
regarded as belonging to Hungary. Despite Magyar protests
the misleading name &ldquo;Croatia&rdquo; was popularly and even in
official documents applied to the whole country, including the
purely Slavonian provinces of Virovitica, Po&#382;ega and Syrmia.
From 1767 to 1777 Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia were collectively
named Illyria, and governed from Vienna, but each of
these divisions was subsequently declared a separate kingdom,
with a separate administration, while the military frontier
remained under military rule. In 1776 the Croatian seaboard,
which had previously been under the same administration as
the rest of the Austrian coast, was annexed to Croatia, but three
years later Fiume was declared an integral part of Hungary.
These administrative changes, and especially the brief existence
of united &ldquo;Illyria,&rdquo; stimulated the dormant nationalism of the
Croats and their jealousy of the Magyars. In 1809 Austria
was forced to surrender to Napoleon a large part of Croatia,
with Dalmatia, Istria, Carinthia, Carniola, Görz and Gradisca.
These territories received the name of the Illyrian Provinces,
and remained under French rule until 1813. All the Croats
capable of service were enrolled under the French flag; their
country was divided for administrative purposes into <i>Croatie
civile</i> and <i>Croatie militaire</i>. In 1814 Dalmatia was incorporated
in Austria, while Istria, Carinthia, Carniola, Görz and Gradisca
became the Illyrian kingdom of Austria, and retained their
united government until 1849. Croatia and Slavonia were
declared appanages of the Hungarian crown&mdash;<i>partes adnexae</i>,
or subject provinces, according to the Magyars; <i>regna socia</i>,
or allied kingdoms, according to their own view. Each phrase
afterwards became the watchword of a political party: neither
is accurate. The Croats preserved their local autonomy, the
use of their language for official purposes, their elected diet and
other ancient institutions, but Hungarian control was represented
by the ban.</p>

<p><i>The National Revival.</i>&mdash;The Croats acquiesced in their position
of inferiority until 1840, when the Magyars endeavoured to
introduce Hungarian as the official language. A nationalist
or &ldquo;Illyrist&rdquo; party was formed under Count Dra&#353;kovi&#263; and
Bishop J. Strossmayer (<i>q.v.</i>) to combat Hungarian influence
and promote the union of the &ldquo;Illyrian&rdquo; Slavs, <i>i.e.</i> the Slovenes,
Croats and Serbs. Ljudevit Gaj, the leading Croatian publicist,
strongly supported the movement. The elections of 1842 were
marked by a series of sanguinary conflicts between Illyrists
and Magyarists, but not until 1848 were the Illyrists returned to
office. One of their leaders, Baron Josef Jellachich, was appointed
ban in 1848. He strongly advocated the union of Croatia with
Carinthia, Carniola and Styria, but found his policy thwarted
as much by the apathy of the Slovenes as by the hostility of the
Magyars. A Croatian deputation was received at Innsbruck
by Ferdinand V., but before its arrival the Hungarians had
obtained a royal manifesto hostile to Illyrism. But failure only
increased the agitation among the southern Slavs; all attempts
at mediation proved unsuccessful, and on the 31st of August
the Croats claimed to have convinced the king that justice was
on their side. On the 11th of September the advance-guard of
their army crossed the Drave under the command of Jellachich.
On the 29th they were driven back from Pákozd by the
Hungarians, and retired towards Vienna; they subsequently
aided the Austrian army against the Hungarian revolutionaries
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jellachich, Josef</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hungary</a></span>: <i>History</i>). The constitution
of 1849 proclaimed Croatia and Slavonia separated from
Hungary and united as a single Austrian crownland, to which
was annexed the Croatian littoral, including Fiume. Austrian
supremacy lasted until 1867; no ban was appointed, and owing
to the suspension of local autonomy from 1850 to 1860 this
period is known as &ldquo;the ten years of reaction.&rdquo; It was ended
by the celebrated &ldquo;October Diploma&rdquo; of the 20th of October
1860, which promised the restoration of constitutional liberty.
But the so-called &ldquo;Constitution of February&rdquo; (21st February
1861) placed all practical power in the hands of an executive
controlled by the government at Vienna. The newly elected
diet was soon dissolved for its advocacy of a great South Slavonic
confederation under imperial rule, and no other was elected
until 1865.</p>

<p>From 1865 to 1867 Strossmayer and the nationalists endeavoured
to secure the formation of a subordinate Austrian
kingdom comprising Dalmatia, Croatia-Slavonia and the
islands of the Quarnero. The Magyars had, however, resolved
to subject Croatia-Slavonia to the crown of St Stephen, and in
1867 had secured control of the finances and electoral machinery.
The office of ban was revived, and its holder, Baron Levin Rauch,
was an ardent Magyarist. At the elections of December 1867
a majority of Hungarian partisans was easily obtained, and
on the 29th of January the diet passed a resolution in favour
of reunion with Hungary. The whole Opposition refused to
take any part in the proceedings, as a protest against the alleged
illegality of the elections; but by the 25th of June the Croatian
commissioners and the Hungarian government had framed a
new constitution, which was ratified in September. Besides
substituting Hungarian for Austrian sovereignty, it provided
that the diet and the ban should control local affairs, subject
to the Croatian minister in the Hungarian cabinet, and that
Croatia-Slavonia should pay 55% of its revenue to Hungary for
mutual and imperial expenses, but should be represented in
the Hungarian parliament by thirty-six delegates, and should
continue to use Serbo-Croatian as the official language. Hungary
guaranteed that the 45% retained by the territorial government
should be not less than two and a half million gulden (£250,000).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
In May 1870 Fiume was annexed to Hungary, but in 1873 the
Croats received as compensation an increase of their guaranteed
revenue to £350,000, an addition of seven to the number of their
representatives at Budapest, and a promise that the military
frontier should be incorporated in the existing civil provinces.
In 1877 a convention with Hungary regulated the control of
public estates in the military frontier, and on the 15th of July
1881 the frontier, including the district of Sichelburg claimed
by Carniola, was handed over to the local administration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the events of 1875-1878 in the Balkans, culminating
in the Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, revived
the agitation for a &ldquo;Great Croatia.&rdquo; A party separate from
the regular Opposition, and known as the &ldquo;Party of the Right,&rdquo;
was formed to oppose the Magyarists. Its activity resulted
in the riots of 1883, which were with difficulty quelled; in 1885
its leader, N. Star&#269;evi&#263;, was condemned to imprisonment for
the violence of his speeches against the ban, Count Khuen-Héderváry.
In 1888 the moderate Opposition also lost its
leader, Bishop Strossmayer, who was censured by the king on
account of his famous Panslavist telegram to the Russian Church
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Strossmayer</a></span>). In 1889 the financial agreement with
Hungary was revised and the contribution of Croatia-Slavonia
to the expenses shared with Hungary or common to the whole
of the Dual Monarchy was raised by 1%. This added
burden combined with bad harvests, a fall in the revenue and a
deficit in the budget to heighten popular discontent. Count
Khuen-Héderváry was responsible for several administrative
improvements, but the prosperity of the country declined from
year to year. The government was accused of illegal interference
with the elections, with the use of the Hungarian arms
and language in official documents, and with undue harshness
in the censorship of the press. In May 1903 there were outbreaks
of rioting in Agram, Sissek and other towns, besides serious
agrarian disturbances directed against the Magyarist landowners;
in a debate in the Reichsrath (18th May) an Austrian
deputy named Bianchini unsuccessfully attempted to induce the
imperial government to intervene. At the end of June Count
Khuen-Héderváry was made Hungarian prime minister; Count
T. Peja&#269;evi&#263; succeeded him as ban, and restored quiet by
promising freedom of assembly and greater liberty of the press.
Since 1898 the financial agreement had only been renewed from
year to year. But the estimates for 1904 revealed another
heavy deficit; and this was only paid by Hungary on condition
that the agreement should be renewed until the 31st of December
1913, and the contribution of 56% maintained.</p>

<p>The constitutional crisis of 1905 in Hungary stimulated the
nationalist agitation. A congress of Croatian and Dalmatian
deputies met at Spalato to advocate Serbo-Croatian unity, and
in 1906 the municipality of Agram endeavoured to petition the
king in favour of union with Bosnia and Herzegovina. This
propaganda was severely discouraged. Baron Rauch, appointed
ban in 1908, refused to summon the diet, in which he could not
command a single vote, and much excitement was caused in 1909
by the trial of 57 nationalist leaders for high treason. The policy
of the nationalists, who now aimed at the political union, under
the king-emperor, of all Serbo-Croats in Austria-Hungary&mdash;upwards
of 4,500,000&mdash;was less visionary than the older Illyrism,
and less aggressively Panslavist. It no longer sought to
include Carinthia, Carniola and Styria in the proposed
&ldquo;Great Croatia.&rdquo; It was opposed by Austria as tending to
create a new and formidable Slavonic nation within the Dual
Monarchy, and by Hungary as a menace to Magyar predominance
in Transleithania.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Language and Literature.</i></p>

<p>For the place of the Croatian dialects among Slavonic
languages generally, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Slavs</a></span>. The Croatian dialects, like
the Servian, have gradually developed from the Old Slavonic,
which survives in medieval liturgies and biblical or apocryphal
writings. The course of this development was similar in both
cases, except that the Croats, owing to their dependence on
Austria-Hungary, were not so deeply influenced as the Serbs by
Byzantine culture in the middle ages, and by Russian linguistic
forms and Russian ideas in modern times. The Orthodox Serbs,
moreover, use a modified form of the Cyrillic alphabet, while
the Roman Catholic Croats use Latin characters, except in a
few liturgical books which are written in the ancient Glagolitic
script. As the literary language of both nations is now practically
the same, and is, indeed, commonly known as &ldquo;Serbo-Croatian,&rdquo;
the reader may be referred to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Servia</a></span>:
<i>Language and Literature</i>, for an account of its history, of its
chief literary monuments up to the 19th century and inclusive
of Dalmatian literature, and of the principal differences between
the dialects spoken in Servia and Croatia-Slavonia.</p>

<p>The three most important Croatian dialects are known as
the <i>&#268;akavci</i>, <i>&#268;akav&#353;tina</i> or, in Servian, <i>Chakavski</i>, spoken along
the Adriatic littoral; the <i>&#352;tokavci</i> (<i>&#352;tokav&#353;tina</i>, <i>Shtokavski</i>),
spoken in Servia and elsewhere in the north-west of the Balkan
Peninsula; and the <i>Kajkavci</i> (<i>Kajkav&#353;tina</i>, <i>Kaykavski</i>), spoken
by the partly Slovene population of the districts of Agram,
Warasdin and Kreuz. This classification is based on the form,
varying in different localities, of the pronoun <i>&#269;a</i>, <i>&#353;to</i>, or <i>kaj</i>,
meaning &ldquo;what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cakavci literature includes most of the works of the
Dalmatian writers of the 15th and 16th centuries&mdash;the golden
age of Serbo-Croatian literature. Its history is indissolubly
interwoven with that of the &#352;tokavci, which ultimately superseded
it, and became the literary language of all the Serbo-Croats,
as it had long been the language of the best national
ballads and legends.</p>

<p>Kajkavci had from about 1550 to 1830 a distinctive literature,
consisting of chronicles and histories, poems of a religious or
educational character, fables and moral tales. These writings
possess more philological interest than literary merit, and are
hardly known outside Croatia-Slavonia and the Slovene districts
of Austria.</p>

<p>Apart from the Kajkavci dialect, the whole body of Serbo-Croatian
literature up to the 19th century may justly be regarded
as the common heritage of Serbs and Croats. The linguistic
and literary reforms which Dossitey Obradovich and Vuk
Stefanovich Karajich carried out in Servia about the close of
this period helped to stimulate among the Croats a new interest
in their national history, their traditions, folk-songs and folk-tales.
One result of this nationalist revival was the unsuccessful
attempt made between 1814 and 1830 to raise the &#268;akavci
dialect to the rank of a distinctive literary language for Croatia-Slavonia;
but the Illyrist movement of 1840 led to the adoption
of the &#352;tokavci, which was already the vernacular of the majority
of Serbo-Croats. Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872), though he failed
to create an artificial literary language by the fusion of the
principal dialects spoken by Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was
by his championship of Illyrism instrumental in securing the
triumph of the &#352;tokavci. Gaj was a poet of considerable talent,
and one of the founders of Croatian journalism. Among other
writers of the first half of the 19th century may be mentioned
Ivan Ma&#382;urani&#263; (1813-1890), whose first poems were published
in the <i>Danica ilirska</i> (&ldquo;Illyrian Dawnstar&rdquo;), a journal founded
and for a time edited by Gaj. In 1846 Ma&#382;urani&#263; published his
<i>Smrt Smail Aga &#268;engi&#263;a</i> (&ldquo;Death of Ismail Aga &#268;engi&#263;&rdquo;),
called by Serbo-Croats the &ldquo;Epos of Hate.&rdquo; This remarkable
poem, written in the metre of the old Servian ballads, gives a
vivid description of life in Bosnia under Turkish rule, and of the
hereditary border feuds between Christians and Moslems. In
later life Ma&#382;urani&#263; distinguished himself as a statesman, and
became ban of Croatia from 1873 to 1880. Other writers representative
of Croatian literature before 1867 were the lyric poet
Stanko Vraz (1810-1851) and Dragutin Rakovac (1813-1854),
the author of many patriotic songs.</p>

<p>With the foundation of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram,
in 1867, the study of science and history received a new impetus.
Under the presidency of Franko Ra&#269;ki (1825-1894) the academy,
with its journal the <i>Rad jugoskovenske Akademije</i>, became the
headquarters of an active group of savants, among whom may
be mentioned Vastroslav Jagi&#263; (b. 1838), sometime editor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
<i>Archiv für slavische Philologie</i>; the historians &#352;ime Ljubi&#263;
(1822-1896) and Vjekoslav Klai&#263;, author of several standard
works on Croatia and the Croats; the lexicographer Bogoslav
&#352;ulek (1816-1895); the ethnographer and philologist Franko
Karelac (1811-1874). In Dalmatia, where the Ragusan journal
<i>Slovinac</i> has served, like the Agram <i>Rad</i>, as a focus of literary
activity, there have been numerous poets and prose writers,
associated, in many cases, with the Illyrist or the nationalist
propaganda. Among these may be mentioned Count Medo
Pu&#269;i&#263; (1821-1882), and the dramatist Matija Ban (1818-1903),
whose tragedy <i>Meyrimah</i> is considered by many the finest
dramatic poem in the Serbo-Croatian language.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CROCIDOLITE,<a name="ar289" id="ar289"></a></span> a mineral described in 1815 by M. H. Klaproth
under the name <i>Blaueisenstein</i> (blue ironstone), and in 1831
by J. F. Hausmann, who gave it its present name on account of
its nap-like appearance (Gr. <span class="grk" title="krokus">&#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#973;&#962;</span>, nap of cloth). It is a blue
fibrous mineral belonging to the amphibole group and closely
related to riebeckite; chemically it is an iron sodium silicate.
Its resemblance to asbestos has gained for it the name Cape
Asbestos, the chief occurrence being in Cape Colony. The
mineral suffers alteration by removal of alkali and peroxidation
of the ferrous iron, and further by deposition of silica between
the fibres, or by their replacement by silica; a hard siliceous
mineral is thus formed which when polished shows, in consequence
of its fibrous structure, a beautiful chatoyance or silky
lustre. This is the ornamental stone which is known when blue
as &ldquo;hawk&rsquo;s-eye,&rdquo; and when of rich golden brown colour as
&ldquo;tiger-eye.&rdquo; The latter, which represents the final alteration
of the crocidolite, has become very fashionable as &ldquo;South
African cat&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; and is often termed &ldquo;crocidolite,&rdquo; though
practically only a mixture of quartz with brown oxide of iron.
The following are analyses by A. Renard and C. Klement of the
unaltered crocidolite and of the blue and brown products of
alteration:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">Another alteration product of the crocidolite, consisting of
silica and ferric hydrate, has been called griqualandite. Crocidolite
and the minerals resulting from its alteration occur in
seams, associated with magnetite and other iron-ores, in the
jasper-slates of the Asbestos Mountains in Griqualand West,
Cape Colony. It is known also from a few other localities, but

<p><span class="bold">CROCKETT, DAVID<a name="ar291" id="ar291"></a></span> (1786-1836), American frontiersman,
was born in Greene county, Tennessee, on the 17th of August
1786. His education was obtained chiefly in the rough school
of experience in the Tennessee backwoods, where he acquired
a wide reputation as a hunter, trapper and marksman. In 1813-1814
he served in the Creek War under Andrew Jackson, and
subsequently became a colonel in the Tennessee militia. In
1821-1824 he was a member of the state legislature, having won
his election not by political speeches but by telling stories. In
1827 he was elected to the national House of Representatives as
a Jackson Democrat, and was re-elected in 1829. At Washington
his shrewdness, eccentric manners and peculiar wit made him
a conspicuous figure, but he was too independent to be a supporter
of all Jackson&rsquo;s measures, and his opposition to the
president&rsquo;s Indian policy led to administration influences being
turned against him with the result that he was defeated for
re-election in 1831. He was again elected in 1833, but in 1835
lost his seat a second time, being then a vigorous opponent
of many distinctively Jacksonian measures. Discouraged and
disgusted, he left his native state, and emigrated to Texas, then
engaged in its struggle for independence. There he lost his life
as one of the defenders of the Alamo at San Antonio on the 6th
of March 1836.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A so-called &ldquo;autobiography,&rdquo; which he very probably dictated
or at least authorized, was published in Philadelphia in 1834; a
work purporting to be a continuation of this autobiography and
entitled <i>Colonel Crockett&rsquo;s Exploits and Adventures in Texas</i> (Philadelphia,
1836) is undoubtedly spurious. These two works were
subsequently combined in a single volume, of which there have been
several editions. Numerous popular biographies have been written,
the best by E. S. Ellis (Philadelphia, 1884).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CROCKETT, SAMUEL RUTHERFORD<a name="ar292" id="ar292"></a></span> (1860-&emsp;&emsp;), Scottish
novelist, was born at Duchrae, Galloway, on the 24th of
September 1860, the son of a Galloway farmer. He was brought
up on a Galloway farm, and graduated from Edinburgh University
in 1879. After some years of travel he became in 1886 minister
of Penicuik, but eventually abandoned the Free Church ministry
for novel-writing. The success of Mr J. M. Barrie had created
a demand for stories in the Scottish dialect when Mr Crockett
published his successful story of <i>The Stickit Minister</i> in 1893.
It was followed by a rapidly produced series of popular novels
dealing often with the past history of Scotland, or with his native
Galloway. Such are <i>The Raiders</i>, <i>The Lilac Sun-bonnet</i> and
<i>Mad Sir Uchtred</i> in 1894; <i>The Men of the Moss Hags</i> in 1895;
<i>Cleg Kelly</i> and <i>The Grey Man</i> in 1896; <i>The Surprising Adventures

<p><span class="bold">CROCKFORD, WILLIAM<a name="ar293" id="ar293"></a></span> (1775-1844), proprietor of Crockford&rsquo;s
Club, was born in London in 1775, the son of a fishmonger,
and for some time himself carried on that business. After
winning a large sum of money&mdash;according to one story £100,000&mdash;either
at cards or by running a gambling establishment, he
built, in 1827, a luxurious gambling house at 50 St James&rsquo;s
Street, which, to ensure exclusiveness, he organized as a club.
Crockford&rsquo;s quickly became the rage; every English social
celebrity and every distinguished foreigner visiting London
hastened to become a member. Even the duke of Wellington
joined, though, it is averred, only in order to be able to blackball
his son, Lord Douro, should he seek election. Hazard was the
favourite game, and very large sums changed hands. Crockford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
retired in 1840, when, in the expressive language of Captain R. H.
Gronow, he had &ldquo;won the whole of the ready money of the
then existing generation.&rdquo; He took, indeed, about £1,200,000
out of the club, but subsequently lost most of it in unlucky
speculations. Crockford died on the 24th of May 1844.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CROCODILE,<a name="ar294" id="ar294"></a></span> a name for certain reptiles, taken from ancient
Gr. <span class="grk" title="kordylos">&#954;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, signifying lizard and newt; with reduplication
<span class="grk" title="korkordylos">&#954;&#959;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, and by metathesis ultimately <span class="grk" title="krokodeilos">&#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#972;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>. Herodotus
makes mention of them, and tells us that the Egyptian
name was <i>champsa</i>. The Arabic term is <i>ledschun</i>. The same
root <i>kar</i> leads through something like <i>kar-kar-ta</i>, <i>glakarta</i>
(<i>glazard</i> in Breton), to <i>lacerta</i> and to &ldquo;lizard.&rdquo; Lacerta in turn
has become, in Spanish, <i>lagarto</i>, which, with the article, <i>el lagarto</i>,
is the origin of the term &ldquo;alligator.&rdquo; This word is, however,
artificial, although now widely used; Spanish and Portuguese-speaking
people in America universally call the crocodile and the
alligator simply <i>lagarto</i>, which is never intended for lizard.</p>

<p>The Crocodilia form a separate order of reptiles with many
peculiarities. The premaxillae are short and always enclose the
nostrils. The posterior nares or choanae open far behind in the
roof of the mouth, in recent forms within the pterygoids. The
under jaws are hinged on to the quadrate bones, which extend
obliquely backwards, and are immovably wedged in between the
squamosal and the lateral occipital wings. The teeth form a
complete series in the under jaw, and in the upper jaw on the
premaxillary and maxillary bones. They are conical and deeply
implanted in separate sockets. They are often shed throughout
life, the successors lying on the inner side, and with their caps
partly fitting into the wide open roots of the older teeth. Especially
in alligators the upper teeth overlap laterally those of the
lower jaw, whilst in most crocodiles the overlapping is less
marked and the teeth mostly interlock, a feature which increases
with the slenderness of the snout. In old specimens some
of the longer, lower teeth work their tips into deep pits, and
ultimately even perforate the corresponding parts of the upper
jaw. The first and second vertebrae each have a pair of long,
movable ribs. There is a compound abdominal sternum. The
so-called pubic bones are large and movable. There are five
fingers and four toes, provided with claws, excepting the outer
digits.</p>

<p>The tongue is flat and thick, attached by its whole under
surface; its hinder margin is raised into a transverse fold,
which, by meeting a similar fold from the palate, can shut off the
mouth completely from the wide cavity of the throat. Dorsally
the posterior nares open into this cavity. Consequently the
beast can lie submerged in the water, with only the nostrils
exposed, and with the mouth open, and breathe without water
entering the windpipe. Within the glottis is a pair of membranous
folds which serve as vocal cords; all the Crocodilia are possessed
of a loud, bellowing voice.</p>

<p>The stomach is globular, rather muscular, with a pair of
tendinous centres like those of birds; its size is comparatively
small, but the digestion is so rapid and powerful that every
bone of the creature&rsquo;s prey is dissolved whilst still being stowed
away in the wide and long gullet. The anal opening forms a
longitudinal slit; within it, arising from its anterior corner,
is the unpaired copulatory organ. The vascular system has
attained the highest state of development of all reptiles. The
heart is practically quadrilocular, the right and left halves being
completely partitioned, except for a small communication, the
<i>foramen Panizzae</i>, between the right and left aortae where these
cross each other on leaving their respective ventricles. The outer
ear lies in a recess which can be closed tightly by a dorsal flap of
skin. The power of hearing is acute, and so is the sight, the
eyes being protected by upper and lower lids and by a nictitating
membrane. The skin of the whole body is scaly, with a hard,
horny, waterproof covering of the epidermis, but between these
mostly flat scales the skin is soft. The scutes or dermal portions
of the scales are more or less ossified, especially on the back,
and form the characteristic dermal armour. The skins or
&ldquo;hides&rdquo; of commerce consist entirely of the tanned cutis minus,
the epidermis and the horny coverings of the scutes. All the
Crocodilia possess two pairs of musk-glands in the skin; one is
situated on the inner side of the lower jaw. The opening of the
glands is slit-like and leads into a pocket, which is filled with a
smeary, strongly scented matter. The other pair lies just within
the lips of the cloacal opening.</p>

<p>Propagation takes place by eggs, which are oval, quite white,
with a very hard and strong shell. Their size varies from 2 to
4 in. in length, according to the size of the species and the age
of the female. She lays several dozen eggs in a carefully prepared
nest. The Nile crocodile makes a hole in white sand, which is then
filled up and smoothed over; the mother sleeps upon the nest,
and keeps watch over her eggs, and when these are near hatching&mdash;after
about twelve weeks&mdash;she removes the 18 in. or 2 ft. of
sand. Other species, especially the alligators, make a very large
nest of leaves, twigs and humus, scraping together a mound
about a yard high and two or more yards in diameter. The
eggs, in several layers, are laid near the top. The adults frequently
dig long subterranean passages into the banks of streams,
and, during dry seasons, they have been found deep in the
hardened mud, whence they emerge with the beginning of the
rains. They spend most of their time in the water, but are also
very fond of basking in the hot sun on the banks of rivers or in
marshes, usually with the head turned towards the water, to
which they take on the slightest alarm. They can walk perfectly
well, and they do so deliberately with the whole body raised a
little above the ground. When their pools dry up, or when in
search of new hunting-grounds, they sometimes undertake long
wanderings over land. But the water is their true element.
They swim rapidly, propelled by the powerful tail and by the
mostly webbed limbs, or they submerge themselves, with only the
tip of the nose and the eyes showing, or sometimes also the back.
They then look like floating logs; and thus they float or gently
approach their prey, which consists of anything they can overpower.
Many a large mammal coming to drink at its accustomed
place is dragged into the water by the lurking monster. Certainly
there are occasional man-eaters amongst them, and in some
countries they are much feared. As a rule, however, they are
so wary and suspicious that they are very difficult to approach,
and their haunts are so well stocked with fish and other game that
they make off and hide rather than attack a man swimming
in their waters. But if a dog is sent in there will be a sudden yelp,
the splash from a big tail, and a widening eddy.</p>

<p>Crocodile stories, not all fabulous, are plentiful, and begin
with one of the oldest writings in the world, the book of Job.
&ldquo;Canst thou draw leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with
a cord which thou lettest down?... Lay thine hand upon him,
remember the battle, do no more.&rdquo; This is a very interesting
passage, since it can apply only to a large-sized crocodile. Now
nothing is known of the occurrence of such in Arabia, but a few
specimens of rather small size seem still to exist in Syria, in the
Wadi Zerka, an eastern tributary of the Jordan.</p>

<p>Crocodiles are caught in various ways,&mdash;for instance, with
two pointed sticks, which are fastened crosswise within the bait,
an animal&rsquo;s entrails, to which is attached a rope. When the
creature has swallowed the spiked bait it keeps its jaws so firmly
closed that it can be dragged out of the water. A kind of plover,
<i>Pluvianus aegyptius</i>, often sits upon basking crocodiles, and,
since the latter often rest with gaping mouth, it is possible that
these agile birds do pick the reptiles&rsquo; teeth in search of parasites.
Being a very watchful bird, its cry of warning, when it flies off
on the approach of danger, is probably appreciated by the
crocodile. But the story of the ichneumon or mongoose is a
fable. Although an inveterate destroyer of eggs, this little
creature prefers those of birds and the soft-shelled eggs of lizards
to the very hard and strong-shelled eggs which are deeply buried
in the crocodile&rsquo;s nest.</p>

<p>Considering the interest which is taken in crocodiles and their
allies, on account of their size, their dangerous nature and the
sporting trophies which they yield, the following &ldquo;key,&rdquo; based upon
easily ascertained characters of the skull, is given.</p>

<p>I. Snout very long and slender. The mandibular symphysis extends
backwards at least to the fifteenth tooth.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5em; text-indent: -2em;">(a) Nasal bones very small, and widely separated from the
premaxilla (which encloses the nostrils) by the maxillaries which
join each other for a long distance along the dorsal mid-line....

</div>

<p>The genus <i>Cracodilus</i> contains seven species. <i>C. vulgaris</i> or
<i>niloticus</i> of most of Africa, is found from the Senegal to Egypt and to
Madagascar, reaching a length of 15 ft. It has eighteen or nineteen
upper and fifteen lower teeth on each side. <i>C. palustris</i>, the &ldquo;mugger&rdquo;
or &ldquo;marsh crocodile&rdquo; of India and Ceylon, extends westwards into
Baluchistan, eastwards into the Malay islands. It has nineteen upper and
lower teeth on either side. The scutes on the neck, six in number, are
packed closely together, the four biggest forming a square. The length
of 12 ft. is a fair size for a large specimen. <i>C. porosus</i> or
<i>biporcatus</i> is easily recognised by the prominent longitudinal ridge
which extends in front of each eye. Specimens of more than 20 ft. in
length are not uncommon, and a monster of 33 ft. is on record. It is
essentially an inhabitant of tidal waters and estuaries, and often goes
out to sea; hence its wide distribution, from the whole coast of Bengal
to southern China, to the northern coasts of Australia and even to the
Fiji islands. Australians are in the habit of calling their crocodiles
alligators. <i>C. cataphractus</i> is the common crocodile of West Africa,
easily recognised by the slender snout which resembles that of the
gavial, but the mandibular symphysis does not reach beyond the eighth
tooth. <i>C. johnstoni</i> of northern Australia and Queensland is allied to
the last species mentioned, with which it agrees by the slender snout.
Lastly there are two species of true crocodiles in America, <i>C.
intermedius</i> of the Orinoco, allied to the former, and <i>C. americanus</i>
or <i>acutus</i> of the West Indies, Mexico, Central America to Venezuela and
Ecuador; its characteristic feature is a median ridge or swelling on the
snout, which is rather slender.</p>

<p>The above list shows that the usual statement that crocodiles inhabit
the Old World and alligators the New World is not strictly true. In the
Tertiary epoch alligators, crocodiles and long-snouted gavials existed
in Europe.</p>
